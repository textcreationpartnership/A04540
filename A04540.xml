         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CHriſtian Reader, I do here preſent unto thee, three Treatiſes joyned together in one book: which I wiſh may proue as profitable to the Church and people of God, as they are needful for this age, &amp; eſtate of things, wherein we liue. Whereabout there are ſome few things that I would advertiſe thee, before thou come to read the treatiſes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That thou wouldeſt obſerue, how our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, giving ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to his Church under the Goſpel, hath derived them from the practiſe &amp; particulars had among the Iewes of old, varying therefro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as litle as might be, in ſuch a different estate. For example, as they had their Synagogues, ſo haue we our particular churches and aſſemblies, Pſal. 74, 8. Mat. 4.23. &amp; 9.35. with Act. 20.28. Col. 4.16. Rev. 2.1. &amp;c. They had in their Synagogues the miniſtration of the word of God and prayer: ſo likewiſe haue we. Act. 13.14.15. &amp; 15.21. &amp; 16.13. with Act. 2.42. 1 Cor. 14.3.15.16. 1 Tim. 2.1. &amp; 4.13.

Lev. 1. &amp;c. Eſa. 53.7 — 10. Dan. 9.24.26.27. with Ioh. 1.29. 1 Cor. 5.7. &amp; 10.16. &amp; 11.23. &amp;c. They had the Sabbaths and Feaſt dayes for the ſolemne worſhip of God, in ſtead whereof we haue the Lords day. Exo. 20.8. Lev. 23. ch. Eſa. 66.23. Zac. 14.16 — 19. with Act. 20.6.7. Rev. 1.10. They had Prieſts for offering the Sacrifices that were types of Chriſts death: we haue Paſtours for celebration of the Lords ſupper, a memorial of his death &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion now performed, and ſtill thankfully to be remembred. Exod. 28. Lev. 1. Num. 16. 2 Chron. 35.1. Ezech. 43, &amp; 44. &amp; 45. &amp; 46, &amp;c. with 1 Cor. 10.

            <p>They had for government, beſides Priests and Levites, Ruling Elders al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, of the chief of the Fathers of Families among them: and we haue for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, beſides the Paſtours and Teachers, the Ruling Elders alſo taken out of the people, in that behalf.

Finally, they had Ieruſalem, where God ſet his name, and the Temple where he dwelt among them, &amp; whither he required them to come with their ſacrifices, &amp;c. Which typed out unto us not onely the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall church, but the particular churches alſo of Chriſtians, where the Lord ſetteth his name, &amp; dwelleth among us by his ſpirit, calling us thither to eate at his Table, and in all things to worſhip &amp; ſerue him according to his word, Deu. 12.5, 6.7. &amp; 16.2.

            <p>By this may alſo appear, how M. Ainſw. in his plea againſt M. Smyth, about the Miniſterie, worſhip, &amp; government of the Church, wrote once well (if he could haue kept unto it) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he asked him, ſaying: <hi>What one thing haue we in the worship of God, which Iſrael had not before us?</hi> M. Ainſw. Defence of Scrip. pag. 10. Which being well obſerved, wil giue good light to many matters now in question. But I wil proceed to other things.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Whereas ſometimes I alledge many Scriptures together, my meaning is not, that each of them proue the point in hand; but that to this end they are to be compared &amp; layd together, &amp; corfirmation of the truth to be derived frò thence, by conſequence, &amp; diſcourſe of reaſon, as in queſtions of religion is woonted to be done.</p>

But afterward, upon divers waighty reaſons, I chaunged my purpoſe &amp; courſe: &amp; of manie Oppoſites haue named a few, &amp; giuen a litle taſt of the manifold Oppoſition that is made againſt us: noting withall a few instances of the many ſhifts, errors, contradictions, &amp; abuſe of Scriptures, into which they run &amp; are caryed exceedingly.<note n="‘" place="margin">M.

                     <p n="1">1. The Word of God is not the bare letter or outward ſyllables, but the intendement and meaning of the holy Ghoſt, by whom it was giuen Which should carefully be obſerved by the due conſideration of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ptures, vvith the circumſtances thereof, and by the conference of other places of Scripture, and the proportion of fayth layd together. Which vvhiles the Anabaptiſts neglect, they look on the Scripture partially, and preſſe the letter extreamely, vvithout conſideration of the true &amp; right meaning thereof: neyther obſerving the time &amp; perſons, of vvhom the Scripture ſpeaketh, nor conferring the Scriptures of the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament together, nor regarding the analogie and proportion of fayth, as they should. Much like as the Papiſts deale, vvhen they preſſe the letter, in other vvords of Chriſt, vvhere it is ſaid, <hi>This is my bodie: Matth.</hi> 26, 26. &amp; others alſo, in thoſe vvords, <hi>Tell the Church, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 18, 17. So in much like manner doe the Anabaptiſts in theſe, <hi>Teach all nations, and baptize them, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 28, 19. Where the Scripture it ſelf being duely weighed, and compared together vvith other places, according to the proportion of faith, it vvill be found neceſſarily to imply the baptizing of children, &amp; ſo to be directly againſt themſelues. The vvord here uſed, ſignifieth to <hi>make ſcholers or diſciples,</hi> and conſequently <hi>to teach:</hi> as may be ſeen, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 27, 57. <hi>Act.</hi> 14, 21. <hi>Matt.</hi> 13, 52. Now the thing to be taught the nations, that they might become diſciples of Chriſt, vvas the Goſpell: as Mark shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, vvhen he relateth the ſame commiſſion, ſaying, <hi>Goe into all the world, &amp; preach the Gospell to every creature. Mark</hi> 16, 15. And vvhat Goſpell?

                     <head>ANSWER.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. Abraham in deed had a carnall ſeed, and temporarie promiſes: but not ſuch onely. For he had alſo a ſpirituall ſeed, and ſpirituall promiſes: whereof circumciſion was the ſeale: As the Lord himſelf shewed at the firſt inſtitution thereof, when he ſtablished his everlaſting covenant with Abraham and his ſeed, to be his God; and the God of his ſeed after him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17, 7 — 10. Now God is our God, onely in Chriſt: in whom the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was eſtablished by his blood, and confirmed with the ſeale of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. As the Apoſtle plainely teacheth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 17. <hi>and Hebr.</hi> 13, 20. and thereupon calleth <hi>the ſigne of circumciſion, a ſeale</hi> (not of an earthly or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie promiſe) <hi>but of the righteouſnes of faith:</hi> which is heauenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 11. <hi>with Gen.</hi> 12, 3. <hi>and</hi> 15, 5, 6 <hi>and</hi> 17, 7 — 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22, 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 19 — 29.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If they meane by <hi>a carnall ſeale,</hi> an outward viſible ſeale: ſo alſo is Baptiſme: but will they therefore call it a carnall ſeale? If they meane, that it vvas viſible in the flesh: there was a ſpeciall reaſon thereof (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that vve alſo haue washing with water, or ſprinkling of water upon the flesh:) for it was to be with blood, and to lead them to Chriſt, who should come of Abrahams ſeed according to the flesh. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12, 3. <hi>and</hi> 17, 11. <hi>and</hi> 22, 18. <hi>and Exod.</hi> 4, 26. <hi>with Heb.</hi> 2, 14, 15, 16. Yet doth not this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us to reaſon from circumciſion to Baptiſme: as the Apoſtle sheweth, who ſo reaſoneth himſelf. <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 10, 11, 12. and as we doe alſo (after the Apoſtles example) from the Paſſeover and other ſacrifices, to the Lords ſupper. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>and</hi> 10, 16, 17, 18.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And where they call it <hi>a carnall covenant,</hi> which circumciſion ſealed: what a ſtraunge maner of ſpeach and opinion is this? The promiſe <hi>of Canaan</hi> (whereunto they would reſtreyne it) was in deed annexed with the everlaſting covenant, which God made with Abraham in Chriſt, for eternall bleſſednes and ſalvation in him. But Canaan it ſelf, was a type of the heauenly inheritance, and of the kingdome of God, in Ieſus Chriſt. Which alſo, euen that joyning of them together may imply. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17, 7, 8. <hi>with</hi> 22, 18. <hi>and Gal.</hi> 3, 15 — 29.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8260:11"/>
Shall we therefore call this <hi>a carnall promiſe?</hi> Doth not God himſelf, who made the covenant with Abraham, call it his everlaſting covenant, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17, 7. and the Apoſtle likewiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13, 20. And shal we then cal or count it <hi>a carnall covenant?</hi> Was not the promiſe this, that in Abrahams ſeed all families of the earth should be bleſſed? <hi>Gen.</hi> 12, 3. <hi>and</hi> 22, 18. <hi>with Act.</hi> 3, 25. <hi>and Gal.</hi> 3, 8. And, that the Lord would be a God to Abraham, and to his ſeed after him? <hi>Gen.</hi> 17, 7, 8. And was this then <hi>a carnal covenant?</hi> Yea was was not the covenant confirmed in Chriſt: and that alſo, 430 yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law was giuen? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 17. Or was it not confirmed to Abraham by the ſigne of circumciſion, as a ſeale annexed to the promiſe of God? <hi>Gen.</hi> 17 <hi>chap. with Act.</hi> 7, 8. Which the Apoſtle calleth, <hi>the ſeale of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of faith. Rom.</hi> 4, 11. And was this then <hi>a carnall ſeale, of a carnall covenant?</hi> How directly contrary are ſuch ſayings &amp; opinions to the word of God?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If Circumciſion was the ſeale onely of the temporarie covenant of the land of Canaan: what then did it profit Abraham himſelf in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, to whom God gaue no inheritance in it, no not ſo much as the bredth of a foot. <hi>Act.</hi> 7, 5. But Abraham <hi>by faith ſojourned in the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as in a ſtraunge countrey, dwelling in tabernacles with Iſaac and Jacob, the heires with him of the ſame promiſe. For he</hi> (euen as we) <hi>looked for a city which hath foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi> And, <hi>they deſired a better countrey, that is, an heauenly: Wherefore God is not aſhamed to be called their God. Heb.</hi> 11, 9.10, 16. From which very ſpeach, that God is <hi>the God of Abraham, Iſaak, and Jacob, Exod.</hi> 3, 6, 15, 16. Chriſt proveth the reſurrection from the dead. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22, 31, 32. <hi>Luk.</hi> 20, 37, 38. Which alſo sheweth the covenant made with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham to be a ſpirituall and everlaſting covenant.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If Circumciſion was the ſeale to Abrahams carnall ſeed, touching the land of Canaan: why then did not circumciſion ceaſe, when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed and poſſeſſed the land? For Sacraments ceaſe, when the promiſes are fulfilled, whereof they are ſignes, and ſeales: as the verie termes of <hi>a ſigne,</hi> and <hi>ſeale,</hi> may imply. And thereupon it is, that we shall haue no need or uſe of prophecies, Sacraments, or other like things, in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen after this life, as now we haue in this life here on earth. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13, 8, 12. <hi>with chap.</hi> 11, 23 — 26.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If Circumciſion was a ſeale to Abraham and his carnall ſeed, onely of a carnall covenant or temporarie promiſe touching the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan: why then did God appoint the proſelytes of the Gentiles that came to the Paſſeover, and their children, to be circumciſed: ſeeing they were not of Abrahams carnall ſeed, nor had the promiſe of the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan? <hi>Exod.</hi> 12, 48, 49.

                     <p n="2">2. But firſt let us note to this purpoſe alſo the doctrine &amp; phraſes uſed by the Prophets: which may giue further light about the queſtion in hand. As when Eſay ſpeaking of the time of the Goſpell, calleth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>the brethren of the Jewes,</hi> and foretelleth hovv they shall be brought <hi>for an offering unto the Lord out of all nations, to Ieruſalem the Lords holy mountayne, as the children of Iſraell bring an offring in a cleane veſſell, into the houſe of the Lord:</hi> that the Lord vvill alſo <hi>take of them for Prieſts and Levites:</hi> And that <hi>from one New Moone to another, &amp; from one Sabbath to another, al flesh shal come to worship before the Lord. Eſa.</hi> 66, 18 — 23. And Ieremie the Prophet, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, David ſhall never want a man to ſit upon the throne of the houſe of Iſrael. Neyther ſhal the Prieſt, the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to doe ſacrifice continually. &amp;c. Jer.</hi> 33, 17, 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Ezechiels prophecie, from the 40 chap. to the end, treateth of the reſtauration of the church, kingdome, and people of God by Chriſt, and ſo of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Chriſtian Church, under the termes and types, of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, miniſterie, vvorship, city, land, common-wealth and kingdome of the Iewes. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 40— 48. <hi>chap.</hi> And (to omit other of the Prophets) Zacharie

And agayne, that <hi>the Gentiles ſhall come to ſeeke the Lord of Hoſts in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and to pray before the Lord:</hi> And shall <hi>take hold of the skirt of the Jewes, to goe with them.

Zach.</hi> 14, 16, 20, 21. And many the like ſpeaches may be obſerved throughout the Prophets, foretelling the time of the Goſpell, with the mercies of God, and our duties therein; vvhich cannot be rightly underſtood or obſerved as vve should, vvithout refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ceremonies and ſtate of Iſrael heretofore. Which alſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sheweth the abolition of thoſe shadowes and ceremonies to be ſuch, as that yet ſtill the trueth and equitie of them remayneth, &amp; is perpetuall, for the churches inſtruction, comfort, and direction continually.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And now that I am giving ſome inſtances out of the Prophets, I wil (before I come to mention alſo ſome particulars in the Apoſtles wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to like purpoſe) note yet further (in divers reſpects) that which the Prophet Amos hath, touching the kingdome of Chriſt in the Chriſtian Church of the Goſpell, vvhen he bringeth in the Lord himſelf ſpeaking thus, <hi>In that day will I raiſe up the tabernacle of David, that is fallen, and cloſe up the breaches thereof</hi> (or hedge the breaches of them,) <hi>and I will raiſe up his ruines, and I will build it as in the daies of old: that they may poſſeſſe the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, vvhich are called by my name, ſaith the Lord that doth this. Amos</hi> 9, 11, 12. Thus prophecied Amos of old. Whoſe ſpeach, how should it be underſtood, or theſe things obſerved in the Church and kingdome of Chriſt, built up among the Ievves &amp; Gentiles, in the time of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell (whereof the Prophet ſpeaketh) if we should not now look unto David, and to the eſtate of his houſe &amp; kingdome, as it vvas heretofore: and ſtill haue relation thereunto, in the Churches conſtitution, reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, miniſtration, and proceeding: alvvayes endevouring to haue the ſpirituall trueth, comfort and benefit thereof more and more among us? To which end, all the phraſes here uſed by the Prophet are vvell to be mynded, for the manifold uſe that may be made thereof. And this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture I doe the rather more particularly inſiſt upon, becauſe the Apoſtles did thus underſtand and apply it, in a controverſie that vvas about cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, in their time: <hi>Act.</hi> 15, 1 — 17. Where vvhen they diſputed, how the Gentiles vvere to be free from circumciſion and the yoke of Moſes Law (vvhich had before ben as a partition vvall betvveen the Ievves and Gentiles) they both by the vvork of God, and from this Scripture obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved vvithall, hovv now the Lord took out of them a people for his name, as the Prophets had foretold. <hi>ver.</hi> 14 — 17. And beſides the things ſpoken of <hi>Davids tabernacle</hi> in both places, note alſo, hovv vvhere Amos hath, <hi>that

To the ſame purpoſe may be obſerved thoſe many places throughout the Scripture, vvhere it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt ſhould ſit upon the throne of David.

Which being rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and ſpiritually applyed, will not onely miniſter unto us much inſtruction and comfort, but vvill alſo plainly manifeſt, hovv vve should novv ſtil haue reference hereunto, in the churches eſtate, and in the many queſtions and controverſies ariſing thereabout. Briefly, theſe things and an hundred the like in the Scriptures, ſufficiently teach us, that although vve be freed from Moſes ceremonies, yet vve may not be aliens from Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels policie. As the Apoſtles alſo taught and shewed the churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2, 11, 12. <hi>vvith Gal.</hi> 5, 1 — 13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3, 2, 3. <hi>and Col.</hi> 2, 8 — 17. <hi>and the vvhole Epiſtle to the Hebrevves.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 5 — 10. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 19, 20, 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19, 10. <hi>and</hi> 21, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. So then (ſtil remembring, as I noted erevvhile, that the ceremonies of Moſes are in ſuch ſort abrogated, &amp; vve freed from the outvvard ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation thereof according to the letter of the Lavv, as yet ſtill the ſpirit &amp; equitie thereof abideth, &amp; vve ſtand bound to the obſervation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of accordingly: notvvithſtanding the many differences of eſtate and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, betvveen them and us:) I come now to the Apoſtles vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, to giue ſome inſtances alſo out of them.

                        </gap> thus the example of Chriſt, being vvell obſerved, is againſt themſelues alſo the example of Abraham; teaching us, that as ſoone as convenient can be, we should be made partakers of baptiſme, as Abraham was of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, &amp; Chriſt of baptiſme by the miniſtration of Iohn the Baptiſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Othervviſe if they vvill urge the example of Chriſt in every thing (for a rule to be followed of us) without conſideration of the ſpecial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and reſpects to be had concerning him: why then are they not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcized, as Chriſt alſo was? <hi>Luk.</hi> 2, 21. why are they baptized before or after they be thirty yeeres old, ſeeing Chriſt vvas baptized at that age? <hi>Luk.</hi> 3, 21, 23, Why haue they not the heauens to open, &amp; the holy Ghoſt viſibly to deſcend upon them, &amp;c. as Chriſt had at his baptiſme? <hi>Luk.</hi> 3, 21, 22. <hi>Matt.</hi> 3, 16, 17. And why doe they not, upon their baptiſme received, faſt fourty dayes and fourty nights, as Chriſt did after he was baptized? <hi>Luk</hi> 4, 1, 2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4, 1, 2. If they anſwer, that theſe and the like things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt had their ſpeciall reaſons and reſpects in him, eyther in regard of his perſon, or of his office and miniſtration, or the eſtate of the Church at that time, and the like: and that therefore they are not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rules to binde all others thereunto: then they anſwer their owne ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection themſelues, and thus let all men ſee that the objection is not of waight, for the point of the queſtion in hand. Or if they vvill not thus anſwer, but vvil make theſe things be generall rules for all to follow, why doe they not then ſo vvalk themſelues, and why are not theſe things had and obſerved among them? The like alſo may be noted about ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and eſtate of others in the Scripture, as haue their ſpecial reaſons &amp; reſpects, differing from the generall rule &amp; courſe preſcribed otherwiſe.

                     <p n="4">4. And finally obſerue herein the ſtrange dealing of the Anabaptiſts, that urge the example of Chriſt in ſuch actions, as had their ſpeciall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and peculiar reſpects, as is aforeſaid: &amp; yet vvill not regard Chriſts example in ſuch actions, as he did upon generall and perpetuall grounds, binding all thereunto.

Or will it follovv, becauſe of their errours &amp; corruptions, that therefore the baptiſme there had, is to be renounced, and another new one to be received? If ſo, then hovv wil they plead for the baptiſme miniſtred among themſelues, that it should not alſo be ſo eſteemed, and renounced, in regard of their errors, and the corruptions in their eſtate &amp; miniſtration, that are among themſelues ſundry waies?</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8260:24"/>
as in their forme of baptiſme may be ſeen: And as the Martyrs, being ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged about their baptiſme received among them, haue alwaies acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hovv alſo will they proue, that it is <hi>a lying ſigne</hi> unto them in their eſtate: ſeeing Baptiſme (as the other Sacraments both in Iſraell and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell) hath this in it to be <hi>a ſigne,</hi> by the ordinance &amp; appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, not at the wil and pleaſure of man? And God is the God of trueth, &amp; appointeth no lying ſignes, but true &amp; holy ones, for his praiſe and our comfort. Neither can mans iniquitie make Gods ſignes to be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſignes: though they may otherwiſe be abuſed extremely. Sinful ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and erroneous it is ſo to think, if not alſo blaſphemous ſo to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Difference then is to be put betvveen Gods ordinance, and mans corruption; between the baptiſme it ſelf, &amp; the maner of adminiſtration thereof; betvveen the ſigne of God, &amp; the errors of men thereabout; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſacrament vvhich God hath inſtituted &amp; giuen to his people, &amp; between the churches eſtate where it is adminiſtred. Gods ordinance, Gods baptiſme, Gods ſigne and ſacrament, is holy and ſo to be acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: whenas Mans corruption &amp; unlawfull miniſtration, the churches eſtate and erroneous opinions thereabout, are ſinfull and accordingly to be eſteemed. And who dare or can annihilate Gods ordinance, for mans erroneous perſwaſions, or the churches corrupt miniſtration thereof? Let theſe things be diſtinguished carefully, and the trueth vvill appeare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. Othervviſe a thouſand errors and evils wil enſue, if theſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be not duly reſpected, both in this, &amp; in other queſtions of like ſort.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. About mariage they haue corruptions, errors, &amp; abuſes in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: will they therefore ſay, that their mariage is not true matrimonie unto them, but an Idoll and lying ordinance? &amp; ſo make themſelues ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, illegitimate and baſe borne? Or think they that therefore their mariage should be renounced, and a new mariage, or nevv vviues to be gotte agayne? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, 1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Meat and drink, flesh and fish, beare &amp; wine, are dayly much abuſed unto gluttony and drunkennes; and ſundry erroneous opinions alſo are held thereabout, among them. Beſides that the Apoſtle ſaith of ſome, their bellie is their god. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3, 19. Shal we therefore ſay, that theſe things are not the true creatures of God unto them in their eſtate, but Idols &amp; lying creatures, or accurſed and deteſtable things, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Euen about the Bible and the Scriptures themſelues alſo, they haue ſundry corruptions, abuſes, and errors, among them, in their eſtate and miniſtration. Shall vve therefore ſay, that the Bible is not the true vvord of God, but an Idol &amp; lying book unto them? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 15, 16, 17.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Yea and the very terme of <hi>abuſe,</hi> vvhich theſe men uſe, doth plainly shevv that it is not indeed an Idoll and lying ſigne: but onely is abuſed by them, vvhether idolatrouſly or otherwiſe, as by mans corruption hath come to paſſe vvith Gods ordinances, in all ages of the world.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And novv to make it more plain, obſerue that it is one thing to ſay
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8260:24"/>
of this or that thing, that it is not the Lords, but an Idoll, a lye, a deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; curſed thing, &amp;c. And another to ſay, Men make this or that to be unto them an Idol, or a vaine thing and unprofitable: or that they hold this or that errour about it: or doe thus and ſo abuſe it, &amp;c. For the one reſpecteth the nature or being of the thing according to Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; the other reſpecteth the abuſe thereof through mans corruption and iniquitie. The Sunne, Moone and ſtarres (as I noted ere while) were idolatrouſly abuſed by the Heathen and Ievves of old: and divers erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinions alſo held thereabout among them. <hi>Deu.</hi> 4, 19, <hi>and</hi> 17, 3. <hi>with</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23, 5, 11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8, 2. <hi>and</hi> 44, 17. Should vve therefore ſay they were not the true creatures of God unto them, but Idols and lying ordinances? Or vvas not God then the Lord of hoſts, but of Idols and lying creatures? And had he not ſtill the ſame ſunne, moone, ſtarres and other creatures (vvhich they did ſinfully vvorship) to be as armies about him alvvay rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to doe his wil? Or vvere they, becauſe of ſuch abuſe, by anie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and a nevv ſunne, moone, ſtarres, &amp; other creatures to be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and had a fresh: if they had ben able to procure it. Thus againe vve may ſee that difference is to be put betweene the being or nature of things in themſelues, according to the inſtitution of God; and betvveene the corrupt abuſe of them, as men make them to be unto themſelues, by their idolatrie or other iniquitie, in this or that reſpect.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Ievves profaned the Temple many vvaies and ſundry times: they ſet Idols and altars up in it, and tables of money chaungers, &amp; ſeats of them that ſold doues: &amp; made it an houſe of Marchandize, &amp; a denne of thieues, in their abuſe thereof. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 16, 10— 16. 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 28, 24. <hi>and</hi> 33, 4, 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Did not both the church in former times, and aftervvard Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles, and the vvhole church in that age, ſtill hold and uſe the Temple, as the Lords houſe, &amp; his ſacred ordinance for the ſervice of his Name? 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19, 14. <hi>and</hi> 22, 3, 4, 5. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29, 3, 4, 5. <hi>and</hi> 34, 8. <hi>Mar.</hi> 12, 35. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19, 45, 46, 47. <hi>and</hi> 21, 37, 38. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7, 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 3, 1. <hi>with Eſa.</hi> 56, 7.

Was Circumciſion novv alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, none of Gods ordinance, but an Idoll? vvas it not the true ſacrament of circumciſion, but a falſe and lying ſigne, a deteſtable &amp; cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſacrament, unto them, in that eſtate? Were not they now ſtil the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God? Or had God broken his covenant vvith them on his part, &amp; turned his ordinances into Idols unto them, becauſe of their idolatries and tranſgreſſions of his covenant?

Or haue the Gates of hell more prevayled againſt the Chriſtian church ſince Chriſts comming, then they did or could againſt the church of the Ievves before his comming in the flesh? <hi>Mat.</hi> 16, 18.

If not, how then alſo and vvhere, hath the ſacrament of baptiſme ben continued and derived unto theſe men them ſelues, from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, unto this day? as I noted here before alſo to be obſerved. Or is one and the ſame ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, in one and the ſame Church, an Idol and lying ſigne unto ſome; and the ordinance of God, &amp; a true ſigne unto others, that doe there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it?

Halting betvveen two opinions pleaſeth not God. If it be an Idol and lying ſigne, it is not the Lords: And if it be the Lords (as vve haue shewed it to be) then it is no idoll or lying ſigne, but Gods ordinance and true ſigne, ſtill continued in their corrupt eſtate and miniſtration.</p>

And baptiſme therfore in like ſort, being novv come in the place thereof. But shall we therefore ſay, that circumciſion, or baptiſme, or any other conſtitutions of God in ſuch Churches unto ſuch perſons, are not the Lords ordinances, nor his true ſignes and ſacraments, but Idols and lying ſignes, deteſtable and accurſed ſacraments and conſtitutions? Take an other inſtance in the Lords ſupper.

                     <p>What notable shifts, errors, contradictions, abuſe of Scriptures, vayne diſtinctions, and odious aſſertions are here couched together? And hovv many in a fevv lynes? Which is the more to be obſerved, becauſe that novv after the trueth herein manifeſted, theſe things are by vvay of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition adviſedly ſet downe and published, for the more colouring and defence of the former aſſertions. So as though for the ſubſtance thereof, they agree vvith the former, yet conſidering the time of the writing and maner of dealing hereabout, they are the more to be regarded &amp; inſiſted upon. But to ſpeak at large of every particular, vvould be long: they are ſo very many. I wil therefore giue short inſtances of each ſort: by vvhich the Reader may better diſcerne, vvhat great abuſe and iniquitie there is in ſuch maner of pleas and treatiſes, how ever covered vvith fair shewes and pretences: which are to common with theſe and ſuch like Oppoſites.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Alſo that they ſpeak of <hi>the abuſe,</hi> when as our queſtion is of the thing it ſelf, notvvithſtanding their ſinfull abuſes thereabout.</p>

                     <p n="7">7.

                     <p n="9">9. And ſpeaking of <hi>the relation that is the mayne thing in a Sacrament,</hi> they make no mention of a ſigne, but onely of a ſeale; neyther therein keep they to the inſtitution of God, as they ought: but tell us vvithall of mens corrupt opinions and blaſphemous aſſertions thereabout,</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Moreover, when they ſay, <hi>as touching the relation (which is the mayn thing in a ſacrament) that it ſhould ſeale up unto them the forgiuenes of ſinnes, &amp; (as they bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemouſly ſay) quite take away ſinnes, and confer grace: ſo it is a vayne idoll and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for neyther doe the true Sacraments in Chriſts Church work any ſuch effect to Gods own people:</hi> if they mean, that the true Sacraments in Chriſts church ſeale not up to Gods owne people the forgiuenes of ſinnes, it is an error: but if they meane that they doe not themſelues take away ſinnes, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer grace (for this alſo they annex with the other) then they uſe shifts, &amp; keep not to the point of <hi>the relation</hi> here ſpoken off, and as it is appointed to be by the Lord himſelf.</p>

If they ſay, they haue the baptiſme aforeſaid, hovv haue they then renounced it, as was to be done with <hi>the calues, brazen Serpent, and heathens idols:</hi> ſpecially when they ſay in particular of <hi>their waſhing with water, in nomine patris, &amp;c.</hi> that it is as <hi>the brazen ſerpent,</hi> which being once <hi>Gods ordinance, was turned into an Idol, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a piece of braſſe vvas utterly deſtroyed;</hi> yea that it is <hi>as the vvork of mens

                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="6">6. That <hi>the Romiſh Baptiſme is an impure Idol in their abuſe, ſtanding up in the place of Chriſt &amp; his precious blood, vvhich it is not, pretending to giue grace &amp; vvash avvay ſinnes, vvhich it doeth not.</hi> But the baptiſme of the church of Rome is Gods ordinance, had and planted there by the Apoſtles, before eyther Antichriſt ſate there, or the abuſes &amp; errors here ſpoken of, were knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or had there at all. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 7. <hi>vvith</hi> 6, 3, 4.

                     <p>But to returne to the point in hand, the Prophet Eſay maketh the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yet more playne, when (prophecying in the dayes of Ahaz, as Hoſeah alſo did) he limiteth the time expreſſely from that day forward, ſaying: <hi>Within threeſcore and fiue yeres, shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.

                        </note> others think) and ended with the laſt captivitie and carying avvay of the Iewes by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezer: this doth directly confirme the particulars, vvhich I haue here before alledged againſt the objections aforeſaid. Beſides that this ſame Prophet,<note n="‘" place="margin">Ezec. <hi>16,</hi> and <hi>23</hi> ch.</note> othervvhere sheweth (as I haue noted<note n="‡" place="margin">Pag. <hi>74,</hi> &amp;c.</note> here before) that <hi>Iudah by her idolatrie and iniquitie, juſtified her ſiſter Iſrael.</hi> So as if by their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, the covenant vvas alſo broken on Gods part, and circumciſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them become a lying ſigne and deteſtable ſacrament: then muſt it likewiſe be in Iudah: And vvhere then was the Church of God, and his ordinance of circumciſion, if it was neyther with Iſraell nor Iudah? But Ieremy ſaith, that <hi>Iſrael was not forſaken, nor Iudah of his God, of the Lord of hoſts, though their land was filled with ſinne againſt the holy one of Iſrael.</hi> And Hoſeah (no doubt) contradicteth not the other Prophets. So as then vve muſt ſtill remember, to diſtinguish betvveene the breach of the covenant on the peoples part, together with the ſpeaches of the Prophets that are ſpoken in that reſpect: and between the breaking &amp; regarding of the covenant on the Lords part, and the things ſpoken by the Prophets in that behalf. When Iſraell played the harlot, and brake the covenant on their part, yet the Lord bare vvith them a long time, &amp; shewed compaſſion upon them, reſpecting the covenant on his owne part, which he in mercy had made with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as novv we haue ſeen out of the hiſtorie &amp; Prophets aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thing vvith the Prophets to ſpeak of things to come as if they vvere already done, becauſe of the certainty of the fulfilling of them accordingly. As when Hoſeah ſaith,<note n="‡" place="margin">

                     <p>Hoſeah moreover was one of the laſt Prophets, that prophecyed to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell before their finall captivitie: and continued prophecying from the dayes of Vzziah, unto the raigne of Hezekiah; in the ſixt yere of whoſe raigne, Iſraell vvas captived by Salmanaſſar king of Aſſyria: So he might now vvell ſpeak of things as already done, which vvere ſo shortly &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be fulfilled.

                        </note> heretofore shevved how theſe will not help the matter, being duely and rightly conſidered: vvhich I shall not need here to repeat. Onely remember ſtill, that though mans idolatrie or other ſinnes may make Gods ſacraments or other conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unprofitable unto himſelf: yet they cannot make them to be lying &amp; deceitfull ſignes; yea they cannot hinder but that in the Lords ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they are unto al, &amp; therfore alſo unto them, the Lords true ſignes and faithfull ſeales (on his part) of the forgiuenes of ſinnes &amp; of eternall life. If men by their owne unbelief and impietie make them unprofitable unto themſelues: shall therefore the infidelitie of man turne the trueth of God into a lye? God forbid.</p>
                     <p>And obſerue moreover, that if the Sacraments were not ſtil the Lords ſignes and ſeales of remiſſion of ſinnes and life eternal: vvofull would be the caſe of the moſt godly on the earth, who ſinne and tranſgreſſe dayly: and vvo vvould it (be in particular) with ſuch as are borne or liue in an idolatrous eſtate, when they repent and turne again unto the Lord. For vvhat should they now doe, to haue aſſurance by the Lords ſeale of the forgiuenes of their ſinnes? Should they be circumciſed or baptized a new? So in deed vvould the Anabaptiſts, whom vve haue confuted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Or can a falſe and deceitfull ſigne, be the Lords true ſeale of mercy unto them? Or shal the ſame circumciſion and baptiſme, which is to day a lying ſigne and a deceitfull ſeale unto men (when they are in Idolatrie or other iniquitie) become unto them to morrovv the Lords true ſigne and ſeale of grace and eternall life? And if the ſame men ſinne likevviſe againe, then it againe become falſe and execrable? And if they repent againe, then the ſame againe be the true and holy ſigne and ſeale of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of ſinnes and life eternall unto them? And ſo change and alter from time to time, to be the Lords ſigne to day, and a lye to morrow, to be the Lords ſeale the next day, and execrable againe the day following; and thus dayly to be turned from a lye to a trueth, and from a trueth to a lye againe, as fraile and ſinfull man shall demeane and cary himſelf? Which vvhat is it els, but alſo to make mans repentance, faith, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and not the Lords free grace, promiſe, &amp; fidelitie, to be grounds and foundation of the Sacraments, &amp;c. And ſo to bring people to Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtry and Arminianiſme in the end?</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, it is not unknowne that the terme <hi>(dying)</hi> is diverſly uſed in the Scriptures: And many both Ievves and Chriſtian writers doe otherwiſe underſtand it here, then of being dead in ſinne, as by their writings upon this place may appeare.

as on the other aforeſaid.<note place="margin">Jonathae f. Vzz. Chal. paraphr. in Hoſ. <hi>13, 1.</hi> David Kimhi. Aben Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra. Sal. Jarchi.</note> And firſt of the Ievv Writers:</p>
                     <p>The Chaldee Paraphraſe expounds it thus, When heretofore ſome of Ephraim ſpake, fear took hold on the people: they had the dominion in Iſraell: but after they turned to the worship of idols, they are ſlaine. Rabbi David Kimhi thus, Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im lift up his head in Iſraell: but after he ſinned in Baal, he dyed. As if he should ſay, He was wounded before his enemies, as if he were dead, becauſe his hand [his ſtrength] went away.</p>
                     <p>Aben Ezra thus, He was accounted as dead: and moreover, becauſe Abiah ſlew all his ormy: Referring it to Ieroboam, who was of Ephraim, as others alſo doe. Salomon Iarchi thus, After he came up unto greatnes, he ſinned in idolatrie: and he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the houſe of Ieroboam was cut off, and likewiſe the houſe of Ahab.</p>
                     <p>As touching the Chriſtian writers, Mercerus expounds it thus, The beginning of idolatrie [in Iſraell] was the worship of the Calues,<note place="margin">Mercerus.</note> brought into Iſraell out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, where Ieroboam had lived an exile. Hereupon there followed an other evill, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Baal the Sidonian idoll, brought in by Iezabel (Ahabs wife) 1 King. 16. What calamitie followed hereupon, he sheweth<note n="†" place="margin">He dyed.</note> in one word: See more in the hiſtorie. The family of Ahab was cut off, the land was afflicted with famine, which was accompanied with the plague &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne enemies, &amp;c. And then againe (applying it to Ieroboam:) After that he ſinned by idolatrie (for Baal is often the generall name of an idoll) he dyed, all his dignitie and beauty being loſt. The houſe of Ieroboam, for the calues that he ſet up, was deſtroyed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of the Lord by the Prophet.</p>
                     <p>Zanchius thus, As there is a threefold generation: a Bodily, when one is borne being conceived by the ſeed of man:<note place="margin">Zanchius.</note> a Spirituall, when one of being the ſonne of Adam is born anew by the boly Ghoſt, to be the ſonne of God: and a Civil, when one from low degree is advanced to ſome dignitie, or is freed from hard ſervitude to happie liberty: So there is a threefold death. A Bodily, when the ſoule is ſevered from the body: a Spiritual, when a man through ſinne is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of the grace of God, which is the life of the ſoule: and a Civill, when a man is deprived of his dignitie and power or kingdome or his happy eſtate. Now by the name of [death] in this place comes properly to be underſtood the Civill death. And that word [He dyed,] reſpecteth two things, both the preſent eſtate, wherein Iſraell then was, and their future eſtate now shortly to come. When therefore he ſaith, [And he dyed,] shewing the other eſtate of Iſraell, ſuch as was at that preſent, and ſuch as should shortly follow after, he teacheth, that the kingdome of Iſrael for their idolatrie, both was ſo far weakned, as it wanted litle of utter ruine, &amp; that short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and certainely it should utterly be deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>Calvin thus, After that they ſinned in Baal, they dyed, to wit, becauſe God deprived the tribe of Ephraim of that power,<note place="margin">Calvin.</note> wherewith before he had adorned it, ſo as they wanted litle of utter decay. For although their kingdome was not yet fallen, yet was it come euen to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, ſo as the Prophet might well ſay they were dead, that did now ſo farre differ from their former eſtate. But where he ſaith, [They ſinned in Baal,] it is certaine that this was not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their idolatrie. Ieroboam firſt made the calues: afterward his ſucceſſour ſett up Baal, and borrowed that ſuperſtition from their neighbours the Sidonians, as is thought.</p>

                        <note place="margin">English notes.</note>And accordingly the notes of our English Bibles haue it thus, The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraimites are not farre from deſtruction, and haue loſt their authority.</p>
                     <p>Druſius thus, That people is ſayd to dye which is utterly waſted and deſtroyed. Amos 2, 2. [And Moab shall dye vvith tumult.] So in another Prophet,<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Haba.</hi> 1, 12.</note> [Thou art God from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,<note place="margin">Druſius.</note> we shall not dye.] Others expound it, he is dead in ſinnes: Which I doe leſſe approue. I had rather thus take it, [He is dead,] he hath received divers overthrowes and ſlaughters, he is fallen into grievous calamities, which afterward perpetuall exile followed. And although cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections be inſtructions: yet when he ſuffered thoſe ſo many evils, they did not profit him at all. So thus I ſay, They could not bring him to life againe.</p>
                     <p>Tremellius and Iunius thus, [He dyed,] That is, he was accounted as dead, being of no account,<note place="margin">Tremel. &amp; Junius. Piſcator.</note> and of no power or might.</p>

                     <p>If one applying this Scripture unto them, should ſay: N.N. was a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elder, and ruled alſo in the church, but when he offended by ſchiſme and falſe doctrine, he dyed: <hi>that is,</hi> he loſt his dignitie and authoritie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Church put fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the miniſtration of the Teachers office, which before he executed vvith good regard in the Church: And that the reſt of them, are dead vvith him in like ſort, according to the place and eſtate vvhich they had in the church formerly: &amp;c. Or, If ſome should ſo apply this Scripture unto them (as they doe to Iſrael) thus: vvhen they offended by deſpiſing and oppoſing the governors &amp; government of the church, by contention, confuſion, &amp; breaking avvay from the church offenſiuely, they dyed; and ſo remayne unto this day, <hi>dead in their ſinnes:</hi> If then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (keeping their ovvne vvords) should infer hereupon, that therefore <hi>the baptiſme and other ordinances of God which they in shevv reteyn, cannot be unto them the ſignes and ſeales of forgiuenes of ſinnes, and of life eternall: and therefore are in their uſe of them, falſe and deceitfull; as be alſo the ordinances of God</hi> (as they call them, that are) <hi>reteyned among the beathens:</hi> Would they now themſelues yeeld, either that the baptiſme, and other ordinances of God had among them, are but reteyned in shew; or that they cannot be unto them the ſignes and ſeales of forgiuenes of ſinnes and of life eternall; or that they are in their uſe of them falſe and deceitfull; or that they be but as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances reteyned among the heathens? &amp;c. Or if they or their children should repent, and returne to the Lord and his Church againe, would they reject the baptiſme they haue, as falſe and deceitfull; and get them another that might be <hi>unto them</hi> the ſigne &amp; ſeale of forgiuenes of ſinnes? Or vvould they ſtill reteyne a falſe and deceitfull ſigne, and ſuch as is no better then the baptiſmes and other ordinances of the Pagans? Or think they that a lying &amp; deceitfull ſigne, which is no better then the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the heathens, can be the Lords true ſigne &amp; holy ſeale of forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſinnes and of life eternall?

                        </note> others under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it of the tenne tribes, expound it thus: <hi>Plead with your mother, plead:</hi> He ſpeaketh here in the perſon of God. Now God uſeth the ſimilitude of marriage. So let us ſee what is the ſumme of the words. If an husband make a divorce with his wife, he bringeth ſome note of ignominie upon their children, which are borne of that mariage. Their mother is put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, therefore the children are leſſe eſteemed becauſe of the divorce. If the husband of froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe put away his wife from him, the children juſtly hate him. What? He loved not our mother as he ought: he kept not the ſayth and bond of mariage. This therefore is uſuall, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens mynds are alienated from the Father, if he deale with the mother inhumanely, or els alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether contumeliouſly. Thus the Iſraelites, when they ſavv that they vvere rejected, vvould lay the blame upon God. For the people here is called the [Mother:] that is, the name of the mother is tranſferred to the body of the people, or to the ſtock of Abraham. God had eſpouſed that people to himſelf, and vvould haue them to be as his vvife. Seeing therefore God vvas the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the people, the Iſraelites vvere as the children begotten of that mariage. Novv after the divorce, the Iſraelites ſaid, that God vvas cruell, becauſe he had caſt them avvay vvithout their fault. The Prophet novv therefore undertakes the defence of Gods cauſe: and yet ſpeaks in his perſon, Plead [ſaith he] plead vvith your mother. Finally this place agreeth vvith Eſa. 50. There it is ſaid in the beginning of the chapter, Where is the bill of divorce? Haue I ſould you to my Creditors? But you are ſold for your ſinnes, and your mother is put avvay for her iniquity. &amp;c. And this all know was ſpoken by Eſay to Iudah, or the Iewes generally.</p>
                     <p>Zanchius alſo writing on <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2, 2. noteth this in like ſort for the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; ſumme of this matter. The Prophet <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> teacheth, that there vvas no cauſe vvhy the Iſraelites should expoſtulate vvith God, that he in putting avvay their mother the Synagogue, did note each of them alſo vvith this marke of infamie, that they vvere borne of fornication. For the vvhole cauſe of this evill and infamie, vvas to be aſcribed to their mother, to vvit, their open and continuall fornication, joyned together vvith untollerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes tovvards God. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thus both the one and the other apply it to the rejection of Iſraell though the one refer it to the time afore Chriſt, the other to the time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And then it toucheth not the queſtion in hand.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, the phraſe of being <hi>named, called,</hi> or <hi>ſaid to be,</hi> is ſometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo put for that vvhich in deed is, or may be ſo accounted: as in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 44, 5. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23, 6. <hi>and</hi> 33, 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13, 13. and the like places. And ſo the Chaldee pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe here expounds it: Yet ſo I will not here urge it. But taking it, that Iſraell was here called <hi>the houſe of Jacob,</hi> and <hi>the people of God</hi> in reſpect of <hi>their owne profeſſion, that would be ſo eſteemed:</hi> yet this doeth not hinder, but that alſo they vvere ſo in deed, albeit they did not vvalk accordingly, as they ought to haue done.

                        </note> The indignitie is increaſed, ſeeing this injurie is done to the people of God. If the Aſſyrians or Ethiopians, or Egyptians, had ben ſpoyled of their princes, this had ben more tollerable: but whenas the people of God it ſelf is ſo cruelly devoured, this is leſſe ſufferable. So where the people of God is deceived, and the trueth is turned into a lye, this ſacriledge is more deteſtable. This therefore is the reaſon vvhy he ſaith, [They which deceiue my people:] This people is holy unto me: for I haue choſen them to my ſelf: when therefore it is corrupted with fraud and deceit, is not euen myne own majeſtie after a ſort violated? is not my ſoverainty diminished?

                           <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.</note> as God alſo other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaith, that he maketh tryall, what the people is, whenſoever he ſuffereth falſe prophets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. This therefore was a juſt recompenſe, that then Sathan had liberty giuen, to pervert ſound doctrine among the people. And none is ever deceived, but willingly and of their owne accord. Although many ſeem to be drawen to deſtruction through their owne ſimplicity, yet alvvayes there is ſome hypocriſy withall. But this doth not leſſen the fault in the falſe teachers
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8260:58"/>
if the people deſerue ſuch punishment: Therefore the Prophet doth nevertheles proceed in his reproof, and ſaith that this was [the people of God.] How? truly by adoption. Although the Iewes therfore caried themſelues unworthy of ſo great honour, yet God accounteth them among his people, that he may punish in falſe teachers the wickednes, which now he accuſeth in them.

                     <p>As firſt, that thus he vvould make Iſraels eſtate, vvhiles yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned in the land of promiſe, and under the Lords covenant, having alſo the great things of his lavv vvritten unto them, &amp;c. to be like the eſtate of the Heathens, vvhiles they vvere ſtraungers from the covenants of promiſe, and had not the vvord and ſtatutes of the Lord giuen unto them: &amp;c.

And againe in the Pſalmes, He will remember his covenant for ever. He ſent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his Name. Pſal. 111.5.9. And in Ezechiell the Prophet. Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will even deale with thee as thou haſt done, which haſt deſpiſed the oath in breaking the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.

As for me, this is my covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, My ſpirit that is upon thee, &amp; my words which I haue put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth, and for ever. Eſa. 59.20.21. with Rom. 11.25.26.27. vvhich laſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (except the laſt verſe) are here mentioned by himſelf.</p>
                     <p>And agreeably vvith the Prophets, the Apoſtles alſo (ſpeaking of the Ievves, and of Gods dealing with them) teach us, that <hi>the gifts and calling of God are without repentance,</hi> ſuch as he cannot repent of and alter. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11, 29. And it were endles to note all the places, and gather the manifold reaſons and aſſertions, vvhich the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles haue hereabout.</p>
                     <p>Now for the point it ſelf (conſidering the perverſeneſſe and wrangling diſpoſition of many) I had rather propound what others haue obſerved concerning it, then further deliver myne ovvne mynd, or inſiſt longer thereupon. Marke therefore vvhat M. Calvin ſaith touching this matter:<note n="†" place="margin">Calvin in Ier. <hi>2, 2.</hi>
                        </note> writing upon <hi>Ier.</hi> 2, 2. This is a very worthy place (ſayth he) becauſe God shevveth that his covenant, though it vvere perfidiouſlly violated by the Iewes, yet is firme and ſtable. For although not al,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 11, 25.</note> that come of Abraham according to the flesh be true and right Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites: yet God alvvaies abideth true, and his calling is without repentance, as Paul teacheth.</p>
                     <p>And againe, writing upon Ezech. 16, 61.<note n="”" place="margin">Calvin in. Zac. <hi>10, 6.</hi>
                        </note> The Lord ſaid a litle before, [I vvill remember my covenant:] now he ſaith, [not by thy covenant.] He reconcileth therefore thoſe things that might ſeem contrary: to wit, that himſelf vvould be myndfull of his covenant, and yet that covenant to be diſſipated, broken, and abolished. He sheweth that the covenant is firme on his part (as men uſe to ſpeak:) but is voyde on the peoples part.</p>
                     <p>And on <hi>Zath.</hi> 10, 6. “ Whereas here God ſaith, that <hi>he caſt away his people,</hi> it muſt be referred to the ſenſe &amp; opinion of men, as otherwhere we haue ſeen: for the adoption
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8260:60"/>
vvas ſtable: but the outvvard appearance might giue another judgement, namely that that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vvas rejected of God. But yet the Prophets meaning is cleare, to wit, that although God had dealt ſeverely with that people, and had moſt grievouſly punished their perfidiouſnes, yet the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengement should not be eternall, becauſe he will giue place to his mercy. Agayne he annexeth the reaſon, [becauſe I am the Lord their God, ſayth he.] By this clauſe he ſignifieth that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option is not voyd, although for a time he caſt away the Ievves. For calling himſelf [their God,] he ſetteth before us the remembrance of his covenant: as if he should ſay, that he did not in vaine make covenant vvith Abraham, and promiſed that his ſeed should be bleſſed. Therefore becauſe God bound himſelf by promiſe to Abraham, here he ſaith [he is that peoples God:] not that he ought any thing unto them, but becauſe of his free grace he choſe aſwell Abraham as his ſeed. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Many the like ſayings and obſervations, might be noted alſo out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writers. But omitting them, I will rather note ſomewhat out of the Scriptures here alledged by themſelues. As namely, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11, 11. where Paul ſpeaking of the preſent eſtate of the Ievves, who refuſed Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exhibited in the flesh: ſaith thus,<note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Haue they ſtumbled that they ſhould fal? God forbid.</hi> Whereas by theſe mens doctrine, Iſraell had ſo ſtumbled and fallen, as euen before Chriſts coming, whiles they remained in the land of promiſe, they were not Gods people, and under his covenant, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11, 20. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the eſtate of the Ievves at this day, ſaith:<note n="‡" place="margin">

Yea, let God be true, but every man a lyar: as the Apoſtle teacheth othervvhere, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, 3.4. and here again annexeth, that <hi>they alſo, if they bide not ſtill in unbelief, ſhalbe graffed in: for God is able to graffe them in againe.

Like as alſo in the next verſes follovving, he doeth yet further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and confirme it, vvhen he ſaith: <hi>As concerning the Goſpell, they are enemies for your ſakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers ſakes. For the gifts and calling of God are vvithout repentance. Rom.</hi> 11, 28, 29.</p>

                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:8260:60"/>Vpon which Scripture, M. Beza writeth thus:<note n="†" place="margin">Bez. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in Rom. <hi>11, 28.</hi>
                        </note> This place doeth manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly shevv, that Paul treateth not of every particular Iew, but of the Iewish nation in general, who as touching the Goſpell, that is, inaſmuch as it admitteth not the Goſpell, to wit, in their preſent eſtate, are [enemies, or] hatefull to God: but as touching the election (that is, inaſmuch as God conſidereth not what they deſerue but what himſelf promiſed to Abraham and his ſeed are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, and therefore will he in his time vouchſafe them his grace and favour: becauſe, although every man be a lyar, yet<note n="†" place="margin">Note theſe things.</note> God will not chaunge his counſell. And this is a moſt firme argument, as being ſuch which is taken from the very nature of God. But this is to be noted again, that here the treating is of the Iewish nation in generall, &amp; of<note n="†" place="margin">Note theſe things.</note> the perpetuall covenant. For God hath his decrees touching particulars, which derogate not from that generality, though they be contrary: as for example, that God hath choſen the Iewes, and yet hath appointed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them to juſt deſtruction. Alſo he decreeth many things for a tyme, which afterward he chaungeth. Yet is he not therefore to be eſteemed changeable, but rather alwayes like himſelf: becauſe that the things which he hath decreed should be perpetuall (as,<note n="†" place="margin">Note theſe things.</note> this covenant with Abraham and his ſeed) they remayne perpetuall: but the things which he hath decreed to be changed in their times (as we ſee the interchangeable &amp; ſucceeding courſe of things every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:) or to be abrogated, (as is come to paſſe with the legall ceremonies) they alſo at their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine times are chaunged and abrogated.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto M. Beza. And whether the man with whom we haue to doe, did not obſerue thus much himſelf, may be doubted.

All which doe both manifeſt his shifts, and convince his erroneous aſſertions, concerning Iſraell.</p>
                     <p>Here alſo is to be obſerved, how ſpeaking of the Ievves novv to be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved:</hi> beſides that he citeth not the verſe, where that terme is uſed, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo leaveth the phraſes of ſpeach uſed by the Apoſtle in the ſame verſe: vvhich are theſe,<note n="†" place="margin">

If he ſay, that Paul in the ſame chapter alſo uſeth the phraſe of <hi>graffing them againe:</hi> I denye it not.

                     <p>And by this occaſion note here, how the ſame perſons (the Ievves) are <hi>enemies</hi> in one reſpect, &amp; <hi>beloved</hi> in another reſpect: <hi>Enemies,</hi> in themſelues;

Theſe things (I ſay) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8260:64"/>
I haue thought it not amiſſe here alſo to obſerue ſomevvhat touching the Apoſtate churches of Chriſtians: and now more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touching the church of Rome, by this occaſion. And this the rather, that I may ſtirre up others (more able) ſeriouſly to conſider of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the further ſearching out and clearing of the truth therein; and becauſe my ſelf haue heretofore ben drawen to write ſomewhat of theſe things already. Which, together vvith that I shall here annex, I doe ſtill leaue to be examined by the word of God. Neyther wil the ſearching of this matter proue unprofitable, if it be done religiouſly, but will be of good and neceſſarie uſe, both for the more ſound convincing of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and for preventing manifold errors and evils, whereunto the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts and others are ſubject in this behalf. Now therefore to proceed and come to the Objection aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, I take an argument from the Baptiſme had in the churches aforeſaid thus. The Baptiſme had in the church of Rome,<note n="*" place="margin">I speake of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme it ſelf: not of the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions thereabout</note> is the Lords baptiſme, the ſigne &amp; ſeale of his covenant, the ordinance of God, had in that Church from the Apoſtles times (before Antichriſt there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe) <hi>Rom.</hi> 6, 2, 3. and ſo is true baptiſme, vvhich is from heauen, and not of men; that one Baptiſme, which perteyneth to the body of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 4, 5. which the Lord hath giuen to his church, and not man: whereof a number of Martyrs and other Chriſtians haue ben and yet are partakers; which ſuch as leaue Antichriſts corruptions, ought not to leaue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, but ſtill to reteyne it, as being the Lords; and ſuch as wherevvith they may lavvfully come to the Lords ſupper; vvhereas no unbaptized perſon may eat thereof: (As I haue shevved<note n="†" place="margin">Pap. <hi>27,</hi> &amp; <hi>34.</hi> &amp;c</note> here before touching theſe particulars at large:) Therefore the Church of Rome, is the Church of God, and under his covenant, and hath ſome of the Lords poſtes &amp; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances yet remaining in it, though mixed with their own inventions &amp;c. And if the church of Rome be thus, then the church of England much more; which is already much purged (by the mercy of God) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, iniquitie, &amp; abominations of the church of Rome. Otherwiſe alſo what vvill become of theſe men themſelues: who eyther haue no other Baptiſme, but that vvhich they had in the churches aforeſaid: or if they take another unto themſelues, run a vvhoring after their owne inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vvithout any vvarrant of the word of God: as I haue shewed here before: <hi>pag.</hi> 27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the churches of Rome and England be not under the covenant of God, but divorced from the Lord, &amp;c. then is there no ſalvation for any in thoſe churches. For out of the covenant of God there is no ſalvation. They vvhich haue not God, to be their God in Ieſus Chriſt, cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And they vvhich are not under the covenant of God, haue not God to be their God in Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43, 11. <hi>with Act.</hi> 4, 12. <hi>and Gen.</hi> 12, 3. <hi>and</hi> 17, 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 2, 38, 39. <hi>and</hi> 3, 25, 26. <hi>and</hi> 15, 11. <hi>and</hi> 16, 31. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14, 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 14 — 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 24, 25, 26. <hi>and</hi> 11, 25, 26, 27. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 8, 15 — 18, 26 — 29. 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 2, 5. Now touching theſe churches themſelues, great difference is to be obſerved.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8260:65"/>
For the church of England, the caſe is far more evident, and vvithout al colour of queſtion, ſeeing they doe freely and fully acknowledge juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith onely in Ieſus Chriſt, without any opinion of the merit of works, or interceſſion of Saints departed, &amp;c. For the church of Rome there is farre more difficultie: where both the merit of works, &amp; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Saints, and the Popes pardons, &amp; purgatorie, with many other notable errors are taught and defended. Yet conſidering that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and hold<note n="*" place="margin">Rhemes Annotat. upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        </note> Chriſt by nature to be truely both God and man, to be that one eternall Prieſt and redeemer, which by his ſacrifice and death upon the croſſe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled us to God, and payed his blood as a full and ſufficient raunſome for all our ſinnes, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without need of any redemption, never ſubject to poſſibility of ſinning: againe, to be the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular advocate and Patrone of mankind, that by himſelf alone and by his owne merites procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all grace and mercy to mankind in the fight of his Father, none making any interceſſion for him, nor giueing any grace or force to his prayers, but he to al: none asking or obteyning eyther grace in this life, or glory in the next, but by him: Conſidering (I ſay) that thus they profeſſe; although herevvith they haue many great errors and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions (as I noted before) by which they are generally ſeduced and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: yet vvho dare ſay, but that God by this faith in Chriſt ſaveth ſome of them, who doe thus beleeue in ſimplicity, and heare not of their other opinions and courſes to be errors and corruptions, nor reſiſt the trueth vvhich God vouchſafeth to shew unto them. And of this mynd concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, I haue ben a long time, &amp; haue by other occaſion<note n="†" place="margin">In the Anſwer to M. Jacob: p. <hi>13,</hi> and <hi>47.</hi> &amp;c.</note> published it, almoſt tvventie yeeres ſince. And am the more confirmed in it, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ſome of them lay downe their liues and dye Martyrs in defence of the Chriſtian faith (acknovvledging Ieſus to be the Chriſt the ſonne of God) againſt the Turks and Moores and ſuch like enemies of Chriſtian religion: beſides that many of the Indians and other Pagans (with ſome Ievves) are by them converted &amp; brought to the profeſſion of Chriſtian religion: among whom I doubt not but the Lord hath and ſaveth his; euen by that knovvledge &amp; faith of Ieſus Chriſt, which by their doctrine &amp; preaching among them they are (through the mercy of God) brought unto. Yea and who can ſay, but that whereſoever the name of Chriſt is preached and called upon, the Lord ſaveth ſome, according to his owne gracious purpoſe and mercy in Chriſt Ieſus: ſeeing that Ieſus Chriſt is the vvay, the truth, and the life; and whoſoever beleeveth in him shal not perish, but haue everlaſting life. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3, 16, 17. <hi>and</hi> 6, 35. <hi>and</hi> 14, 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 8, 37. <hi>and</hi> 16, 30, 31. <hi>and</hi> 17, 2, 3, 4. <hi>and</hi> 18, 25 — 28. <hi>and</hi> 28, 14, 23, 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10, 9 — 13. Here alſo to the ſame purpoſe might be obſerved, that out of the Church there is no ſalvation: vvhich I ſuppuſe themſelues will not deny. And (that which is more) that the Lords conſtitutions ceaſe not to be his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinances, though the people that enjoy them, should haue no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof to ſalvation, but uſe, or abuſe them rather, to their owne greater condemnation. But omitting this, I proceed to other reaſons, as follovveth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It hath ben the great queſtion between the Ievves and us, ever ſince the Apoſtles times, and ſtill is, whether Ieſus be the Chriſt that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8260:65"/>
and vvhether the Iewes, or Chriſtians, novv be the church of God. Now alſo there are in the vvorld the Chriſtians, the Ievves, the Turks, &amp; Pagans. If then the queſtion be asked, vvhich of theſe is the church of God at this day? should we not anſvver, <hi>The Chriſtians:</hi> and among the Chriſtians alſo compriſe the churches aforeſaid, for the reaſons before ſpecified.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Seeing baptiſme is among Chriſtians a viſible ſigne of the viſible Church of God, as circumciſion vvas of old among the Ievves: hovv can vve ſoundly defend &amp; reteyn the viſible baptiſme received in the church of Rome; and that alſo vvith reference to the circumciſion received in the apoſtaſies of Iudah and Iſraell: if vve doe not accordingly acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Church of Rome, to be a viſible church and the people of God, as Iudah and Iſraell vvas in their defection? (of which more in the next reaſon follovving.)

In which reſpect, the tearme of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> is very fit and godly, and the proceeding accordingly: Whereas the courſe and dealing of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and all ſuch, as eyther begin all a new, or averre ſuch aſſertions as doe neceſſarily imply it, is not onely prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but excedingly ſinfull and erroneous. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7, <hi>and</hi> 11, <hi>and</hi> 14, <hi>chapters, with</hi> 18, 4. <hi>and Eſa.</hi> 48, 20. <hi>Ier.</hi> 50, 8. <hi>and</hi> 51, 45, 50. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29, 5 — 17. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c. and</hi> 3, 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.

                     </p>
                     <p>Finally, if the former aſſertions were true, and that there were not any of Gods poſts, thresholds, or ordinances at all left in that church: then would it follovv on the one hand, that <hi>the apoſtaſie of the man of ſinne</hi> were not <hi>a myſterie of iniquitie</hi> (as the Apoſtle calleth it) but that all might eaſily diſcerne and avoyde it: and on the other hand, that none of that church, ſynce the <hi>apoſtaſie aforeſaid,</hi> should be ſaved. Which apoſtaſie, ſome begin tvvo hundred yeres after Chriſt, ſome three hundred yeres (in Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines time) ſome four, ſome fiue, ſome ſixe hundred yeres after Chriſt: &amp; the Apoſtle Paul ſaith, <hi>the myſterie of that iniquity wrought already, in his dayes.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ,</hi> 2, 7.

                     <p>Difference therefore (as I haue noted before) is to be obſerved &amp; put betvveen the church, and the apoſtaſie thereof; betvveen the houſe of God, and the pollutions thereof; between the Lords poſts &amp; thresholds, and mans inventions and ſuperſtitions commingled therevvith; between the trueths and ordinances of God that ſtill are kept, and the errors and corruptions of men that are brought in and reteyned vvithall; betvveen the Temple of God, and Antichriſts ſitting therein; betvveen the Court and holy City, and the Gentiles to vvhom they are giuen to tread upon, for the time appointed, &amp;c. In regard of vvhich difference, divers things are accordingly ſpoken, and different phraſes uſed in the Scriptures, &amp; in the ſpeaches and vvritings of men. Which vvhiles many doe not obſerue or regard, vvhereas they think to hold the trueth firmely, they run into errour upon errour extreemely.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Laſtly, as in Iſrael and Iudah, when they fel into apoſtaſie, they cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not preſently to be the church and people of God, neyther did the Lord forthwith caſt them off and giue them a bill of divorce, but did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, time after time, plead vvith them, call them to repentance, and convince them by his Prophets and ſervants, beſides his avvakening of them by ſundry corrections and punishments: ſo should we likevviſe obſerue about the Church of Rome, and the like: which haue for a long time layd (as it vvere) lulled a ſleep in ſecuritie: whom the Lord notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hath by his witneſſes and ſervants from time to time, &amp; of late (ſynce Luthers time) more earneſtly and many wayes ſet to avvaken, &amp;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8260:73"/>
to plead againſt them, calling them to repentance, and convincing them dayly more and more. Which work the Lord vvill not ſlack, but wil ſtill follovv on and proſecute, till he haue in all things accomplished it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ovvne purpoſe, to the praiſe both of his mercy and juſtice, in the end. In the mean time, vvhiles the Lord is pleading with that church, diſcovering more &amp; more the apoſtaſie &amp; iniquitie thereof by the light of his vvord, and teſtimonie of his ſervants: vve should not deny it to be the church and Temple of God, though Antichriſt ſit therein, and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pollute it: but becauſe ſo it is, we should therefore the more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet our ſelues to plead the Lords cauſe vvith it, againſt the apoſtaſie thereof, and in all things (vvhat lyeth in us) to diſcover the iniquity of the Man of ſinne, (the Beaſt, the Antichriſt) that is ſet therein: untill the Lord haue conſumed that lawles one, &amp; powred out the vial of his wrath upon the Beaſts throne, &amp;c. fully performing his work upon the myſticall Babylon, as he hath ſeverely denounced, and expreſſely foretold, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 3 — 8. <hi>with Rev.</hi> 11, 2, 3. <hi>and</hi> 16, 10, 11. <hi>and</hi> 17, <hi>and</hi> 18 <hi>chap. &amp;c.</hi> and as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his work on the Chaldean Babylon heretofore. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50, <hi>and</hi> 51.</p>
                     <p>Where obſerue, that the Scripture in theſe places ſpeaketh not of Gods Temple, Court, City or church to be deſtroyed; but of the Man of ſinne, to be the ſonne of perdition; of the lavvleſſe one to be conſumed and abolished, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 3, 8. of the viall of Gods vvrath to be powred on the Beaſts throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16, 10. of the Beaſt to goe into perdition, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17, 11. of the great City Babylon, to be burnt vvith fier, and to be throvvn downe, that she shall no more at all be found; <hi>Rev.</hi> 18, 8, 20, 21.

                     <p>Finally it vvere a very good thing (conſidering the manifold objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hereabout) that theſe men would shevv the time, when the churches aforeſaid vvere by the Lord put from under his covenant, and had a bill of divorce giuen unto them &amp;c. Which how it is urged by the Papiſts themſelues concerning the church of Rome (and ought a thouſand fold more to be urged in behalf of the church of England) vvho can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant?

Secondly, I doe ſtill profeſſe, that the hierarchie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, both is of Sathan, &amp; is an apoſtaſie moſt deteſtable. But this now further vvithall, that popular anarchie alſo is moſt ſinfull and miſerable. They are both of them extreems, and religiouſly to be avoyded. The middle vvay is the right vvay, namely, Gods ordinance of the Eldership, vvhich should carefully be kept intire, againſt all uſurpation both of the Prelacy of the one hand, and of the people on the other. Thirdly, I doe now obſerue (more, and in ſome things othervviſe then before) a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the churches conſtitution, &amp; the hierarchie of Antichriſt, brought in upon it: alſo, betvveen Antichriſt vvith his hierarchie (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about our queſtion is not) and the Temple or church of God, vvherein he ſitteth: whereabout our queſtion is; &amp; whereunto this man keepeth not. Of which more hereafter: beſides that vvhich hath ben ſpoken therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout already. His reproachfull ſpeaches here and throughout his book, I leaue upon his ovvne head. And now I come unto his anſvver, which next follovveth.</p>
               <p>Where firſt he anſwereth, that in the former allegation of 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4. &amp; the reaſon deduced from thence, <hi>truth and error are cloſely cowched together.</hi> But he telleth not vvhat he acknovvledgeth for <hi>truth,</hi> and what he taketh to be <hi>error.</hi> If ſo he had done, it may be he would haue ben found eyther to acknowledge the trueth, vvhich novv he ſets himſelf to oppugne, or that his ovvne errors vvould the ſooner and better haue appeared, which he vvould novv covvch and cary avvay as cloſely as he can.</p>
               <p>But <hi>for diſcerning hereof,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>we are to conſider, firſt how Antichriſts church is deſcribed in Gods vvord: ſecondly, what the ſtate of the church of Rome is at this day.</hi> And ſo proceeding in his deſcription, he ſpeaketh of the <hi>Church and Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Antichriſt,</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> of the <hi>great City,</hi> of the <hi>man of ſinne,</hi> of the <hi>great vvhore,</hi> of <hi>Abaddon or Apollyon, the ſonne of perdition, &amp;c.</hi> whereas he should treat of <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> vvhereof Paul ſpeaketh, vvhoſe writings I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he vvill not deny to be <hi>Gods vvord.</hi> But thus it was beſt for his plea,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8260:75"/>
to keep (what he could) from the point of the queſtion in hand, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo to confound things that differ, as he doeth throughout his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. So all his plea is frivolous, and not to the purpoſe.</p>

                  </note> he tels us of a <hi>Church,</hi> ſuch as Bellarmine and others deſcribe, <hi>one part vvhereof liues on earth, an other under the earth, and a third part in heauen, &amp;c.</hi> whereas our queſtion is of <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> vvhereof Paul ſpeaketh 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4. and of the <hi>Court and holy City,</hi> vvhereof Iohn ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11, 2. vvhich heretofore<note n="*" place="margin">M.

                  </note> this man himſelf acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and proved by the Scriptures to be the <hi>Church of God.</hi> Yet the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other Papiſts were extant then, aſvvell as now: and the <hi>novv Romiſh religion</hi> (whereof he ſpeaketh) deſcribed their church then, as novv it doeth. But the caſe is altered with himſelf: vayn shifts &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are become his uſuall pleas in oppoſition of the truth, and for the maintenance of his errors and evill dealing.</p>
               <p>After theſe things premiſed, comming (as he ſaith) <hi>to our arguments:</hi> he ſpeaketh as follovveth.<note place="margin">M. Ainſw. p. <hi>77, 78.</hi>

                  <hi>Their firſt reaſon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4. <hi>is unperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged, for the text there ſaith of the Man of ſinne, that he doth</hi> ſit as God in the Temple of God: <hi>whereupon their concluſion muſt be, that</hi> Antichriſt ſitteth as God in the Church of God. <hi>And if they can proue that he is</hi> the true God, <hi>I will yeeld that his Temple is the true Temple, and his church</hi> the true church. <hi>Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weiſe, if he be but an Idoll and not God: his Temple church and body, will proue but an Idoll like himſelf, and his</hi> blaſphemie <hi>is vvorſe then theirs</hi> which ſaid,<note n="“" place="margin">

                  <hi>they were Ievves and were not, but did lye, and vvere the Synagogue of Sathan.</hi> Theſe are M. Ainſw. words: and this anſwer he giveth to that vvhich I obſerved out of 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4. vvhich I noted dovvne<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 140.</note> here a litle before. Now hovv full of shifts, errors, abſurdities, abuſe of Scripture, and contradiction to himſelf this anſvver is, the text and matter it ſelf declareth. Of vvhich I vvill ſpeak ſtraight vvay. But firſt mark, and in ſome reſpects marvell, how all theſe should proceed from this man, in this matter, in one and ſo short a ſpeach &amp; paſſage: if it vvere not that God would thus shew his juſt work in him, for the more humbling of himſelf, and warning of others by his example to take heed of ſuch cariage and dealing, as he is fallen into.</p>
               <p>Novv touching the matter in hand, although I could alledge (vvhich perhaps himſelf would upon like occaſion) that thoſe words <hi>(as God)</hi> where about he cavileth and uſeth his courſe of shifting, are not in the Claro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montane Greek copie of the Original, neyther in the Syriack or old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Tranſlations,<note place="margin">Bez. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in <hi>2</hi> Theſ. <hi>2, 4</hi>
                  </note> as M. Beza obſerveth in his Annotations upon this place: yet vvil I not inſiſt thereupon, but keep unto the vvords, as they are in the Greek copies and tranſlations uſually.</p>
               <p>And firſt, let this be noted &amp; remembred, that the queſtion here trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted off, vvas, <hi>vvhether the church of Rome vvere the church of God, or no:</hi> vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I alledged thoſe vvords of the Apoſtle, vvhere he ſaith that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt should ſit <hi>in the Temple of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4. and ſo inſiſted thereon: And that the queſtion vvas not, about the maner of Antichriſts ſitting in the Temple of God, vvhether he should ſit <hi>as God</hi> therein, or no. For that was
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8260:75"/>
not the point in hand, nor is called in queſtion betvven us. And therefore I needed not novv alledge theſe words, or inſiſt thereupon. And this is knowen to be uſuall in all vvriters and diſputers, ſometimes not ſo much as to mention, ſometimes not to inſiſt at all upon ſuch words, whether of Scripture, or of other vvriters, as perteyn not to the argument and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, or may well be omitted in other reſpects. Which this man himſelf knovveth ſo vvell, as I need not giue him any inſtances thereof. Let his ovvn vvritings and other mens be obſerved hereabout. Or to let them alone, obſerue but theſe allegations in the Scripture, with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars there mentioned and treated off, viz. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 26. <hi>compared with Hag.</hi> 2, 6. <hi>Alſo Rom.</hi> 10, 6, 7, 8. <hi>with Deut.</hi> 30, 11 — 14. <hi>And Mat.</hi> 21, 8. <hi>with Zach.</hi> 9, 9. So all this anſvver is but a shift and a meer cavill.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the queſtion and point in hand, mark the words of the text, that <hi>the Man of ſin oppoſeth &amp; exalteth himſelf aboue al that is called God, &amp;c. ſo that he as God ſitteth in the Temple of God &amp;c.</hi> In the Temple of God, ſaith the text: it ſaith not, <hi>As in the Temple of God:</hi> as this mans exception would imply, with the inferences made thereupon. In deed the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the maner of Antichriſts ſitting, ſaith, that he ſitteth <hi>as God:</hi> but ſpeaking of the ſeat where he ſitteth, he ſaith expreſſely, <hi>in the Temple of God:</hi> and ſaith not, <hi>as in the Temple of God:</hi> as the anſwer here would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: vvhich therefore is meerly shifting and full of deceit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he doeth not onely corrupt the text with evill gloſes (one upon another) but he doeth in deed abuſe the Scripture and directly pervert it, vvhen for an inference he ſaith, <hi>If they can proue that Antichriſt is the true God,</hi> &amp;c. as if Pauls vvords were not plaine to ſuch as will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that Antichriſt exalteth himſelf aboue all that is called God, ſo that he <hi>as God,</hi> ſitteth in the Temple of God, &amp;c. and therefore is not <hi>the true God,</hi> but the man of ſinne, &amp; ſonne of perdition, although that he <hi>as God</hi> ſit in the Temple of God, shewing himſelf that he is God. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, difference is to be put (as I haue noted here before) between <hi>the man of ſinne</hi> that ſitteth, and betvveen <hi>the Temple</hi> vvherein he ſitteth. The Man of ſinne himſelf (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſitteth as God:</hi> yet the Temple wherein he ſitteth (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle) is <hi>the Temple of God.</hi> And other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe how is it poſſible, if he vvere in deed true God ſitting in the Temple of God, that he should alſo be the Man of ſinne, and ſonne of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. But ſee the like in the caſes (<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 125 126. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> before mentioned) that fell out at Ieruſalem and the Temple there: vvhen Baals Idoll of indignation vvas ſet at the entry of the houſe of God, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 8, 3, 5. and vvhen Antiochus Epiphanes and his Officers profaned the Sanctuarie &amp; city of Ieruſalem, and ſet the image of Iupiter Olympius in the Temple and ſeat of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11, 31, 36. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who vvould not novv put difference between the idols and perſons aforeſaid, on the one hand; and betvveen the Temple and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, vvherein they vvere ſet, &amp; vvhich they polluted, on the other. And if queſtion should be made, vvhether the Temple and city ſo pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vvere yet ſtill notwithſtanding the Temple and city of God: and one
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8260:76"/>
for proof thereof, should alledge the Scriptures aforeſaid: would any Oppoſite now reaſoning thereabout, be ſo abſurde and voyd of reaſon, as to make this or ſuch like inference thereupon, <hi>If they can proue that the idoll of Baal or Iupiter, that Antiochus or any of his Officers is the true God, then I wil yeeld that Baals Temple, Jupiters Temple, Antiochus and his Officers Temple, is the true Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and their city the true city. Otherwiſe &amp;c.</hi> Or vvho vvould not rather in the feare of God reaſon thus: Although that Baal, Iupiter, Antiochus and his Officers, be idols and vile perſons, yea an abomination of deſolation: yet the Sanctuarie and city of Ieruſalem, wherein they were ſet, and which they profaned, were ſtill Gods Temple and holy city notvvithſtanding.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, obſerue here &amp; throughout his treatiſe, hovv ſtill he calleth that <hi>the Temple, Church and body of Antichriſt,</hi> vvhich Paul expreſſely and purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calleth <hi>the Temple of God.</hi> And ſo therein note ſtill his shifts, and his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, &amp;c. When Antiochus had polluted the <hi>Temple of God at Jeruſalem,</hi> and had ſet the <hi>image of Iupiter Olympius therein,</hi> he ſent then alſo an old man of Athens to compell the Iewes to call it <hi>the Temple of Jupiter Olympius.</hi> 2 <hi>Mach.</hi> 6, 1, 2. Antichriſt likevviſe (typed by Antiochus) hath polluted the Temple of God in the church of Rome, &amp; other like churches, <hi>ſitting therein as God and ſhewing himſelf to be God.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4. and novv cometh this man of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and (like the old man of Athens) wil needs call it, &amp; perſwade others to eſteem and call it, <hi>the Temple of Antichriſt, the church of Antichriſt, the body of Antichriſt, the Synagogue of Sathan, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, he doeth not onely pervert the Scripture, but alſo croſſe &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it, vvhiles that vvhich the Apoſtle ſaith is the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> he ſaith it is <hi>an idoll, like Antichriſt himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, hovv ever he vvould shift of, pervert, &amp; obſcure this Scripture, and the matter in hand: yet the light of the trueth ſo shineth before his eyes, as euen here himſelf is forced to note and ſet it downe, that <hi>upon the Apoſtles words, who ſaith, the man of ſinne ſitteth as God in the Temple of God, our concluſion muſt be, that Antichriſt ſitteth as God in the church of God.</hi> Theſe are his owne words: and ſo in deed let this be our concluſion, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) is exalted aboue all that is called God, or that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped: ſo that <hi>he as God ſitteth in the church of God.</hi> Now then this man himſelf cannot deny, but the Apoſtles vvords will beare this inference: yea he ſaith, our concluſion <hi>muſt be</hi> thus hereupon. So notwithſtanding all his ſtrugling and oppoſition here againſt, he is now driuen (nill he, will he) to giue us the cauſe againſt himſelf: and to overthrovv all his ovvne writing hereabout. Which being novv done by himſelf: I may the better ſpare labour, in manifeſting the vanity and iniquity of his pretended ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. Onely (becauſe the point is of vvaight, and of needfull uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts and Anabaptiſts) I will here briefly note a fevv things more, which may giue ſome light for the preſent, and occaſion of further ſearch hereafter, about this matter.</p>
               <p>And firſt, ſeeing novv themſelues affirme, that our concluſion, upon the Apoſtles words, muſt be this, <hi>that Antichriſt as God ſitteth in the church of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8260:76"/>
God:</hi> I aske, vvhat church of God it is, vvhereof the Apoſtle ſaith here, that <hi>Antichriſt as God ſitteth therein.</hi> If they ſay, it is the church of Rome, they giue us the cauſe. If they ſay, it is not the church of Rome, but ſome other, let them then shew it. But in the vvhole proceſſe of this treatiſe of theirs, they ſtill ſpeak of the church of Rome. And all the termes that here are uſed by the Apoſtle, of the <hi>man of ſinne, the ſonne of perdition, his oppoſition, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, his ſitting as God, his ſhewing himſelf to be God, &amp;c.</hi> they apply to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt the Pope of Rome and his hierarchie. But vvhen they come to this other clauſe of <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> to expound it of <hi>the Temple body and Church of Antichriſt, the Synagogue of Sathan, the Temple of the divell, &amp;c.</hi> as they ſpeak almoſt in every ſentence of their treatiſe hereabout; and this alſo in ſuch ſort, as they vvill not haue it underſtood to be the church of God; hovv ſtraunge is this? how far differing from their better and ſounder vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings heretofore? If vve should thus expound and apply the Scripture, what outcryes should we heare, what reproach should we beare at their hands? When M. Sm. (as vve ſavv<note n="‘" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 133</note> erevvhile) applied <hi>the city &amp; court with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Temple,</hi> (ſpoken off <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, 2.) to the <hi>confuſed aſsemblies of Antichriſt, &amp; Antichriſtian perſecuters,</hi> M. Ainſ. could not bear it, that the <hi>Court of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould betoken Antichriſts church, &amp;c.</hi> but did ſoundly convince and sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuke him. Yet now loe, himſelf in this treatiſe, vvill haue the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> ſpoken off 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4. not onely to ſignifie the church of Antichriſt, the Synagogue of Antichriſt, the Temple, Church and body of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, &amp;c. but cannot endure that others should otherwiſe underſtand it, of the <hi>church of God:</hi> as by his writing, reviling, &amp; aſſertions may appeare.</p>
               <p>Here therefore for the better clearing &amp; underſtanding of the matter, let me aske moreover, whether theſe two propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s come to a like end, &amp; agree the one vvith the other, to note out the ſame thing, or not: viz. 
<q>The man of ſinne ſitteth in the Temple of God.</q> And, 
<q>Antichriſt ſitteth<note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>or,</hi> in the Church of Rome, and other like churches of Chriſtians.</note> in the church of Rome.</q>
               </p>

               <p>Novv vvhere he ſaith, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> (the Pope) <hi>proclaimeth himſelf to be the bridegrome of the church, which is the office of Chriſt; to be the Greateſt high-priſt; to haue power aboue all power, as well of heauen as of earth, &amp;c.</hi> theſe things plainly
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8260:78"/>
perteyne to thoſe clauſes of the Apoſtle, where he deſcribeth Antichriſt, vvith his hierarchie, to the <hi>man of ſinne, the ſonne of perdition, who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf aboue all that is called God, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo touch not in deed the point of the controverſie betvveen us; vvhich is not of Antichriſt that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, &amp;c. but of the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> vvhere he ſitteth. Onely note this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that it is in ſome reſpect againſt himſelf, &amp; may alſo giue ſome light to the queſtion in hand, inaſmuch as theſe things (by his ovvne graunt here) are aſcribed to <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Pope;</hi> by vvhom there is no doubt, but he meaneth the <hi>Pope of Rome.</hi> Whereupon it will follow, that if there we fynd Antichriſt the man of ſinne thus ſet, there alſo muſt be ſound the Temple of God vvherein thus he ſitteth.</p>
               <p>Next he ſaith, that <hi>ſecondarily the Temple figured the Church, but firſt the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or univerſall Church, Epheſ.</hi> 2, 21. <hi>then every particular Church</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Note this: for propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion kept with Iſrael: which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we speake of it, he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth. Animad. p. <hi>15.</hi> &amp;c.</note>

But yet of neyther of the tvvo, would he haue it here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: &amp; therefore bringeth exceptions concerning both. Which let the Reader well obſerue and remember.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>when the Apoſtle telleth us, that Antichriſt</hi> ſitteth as God, in the Temple of God, <hi>it is to be underſtood of their invading and deſtroying of Gods church and people, as the heathens of old dealt vvith Jeruſalem and dwellers therein.</hi> Hovv contradictorie theſe are the one unto the other, vvho can not diſcerne? and hovv novv will he reconcile theſe two together, that by the <hi>Temple of God</hi> is meant here, <hi>Gods Church invaded and deſtroyed by Antichriſt:</hi> and yet that by the <hi>Temple of God</hi> here, is not to be underſtood the <hi>church of God, neyther univerſall, nor particular?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he ſaith, <hi>we ſhevv not which of theſe two we intend.</hi> Neither doeth he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he ſaith here preſently after, that <hi>Antichriſt invaded and deſtroyed Gods church</hi> here meant by the <hi>Temple of God.</hi> Neyther did he it heretofore, when vvriting againſt M.

But now (to deſtroy that vvhich he built be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) he ſets himſelf to perſwade, that it can neyther be underſtood of a particular Church, nor of the catholick or univerſall. So as I might leaue him to mainteyne or to reverſe his ovvne expoſition hereof, vvhether he thinks to be beſt and in the meane time to conſider how all this treatiſe, vvhich he intended againſt us, fals upon his owne head, and (if he think there be any waight in it) is in deed againſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the point is of ſo great moment, although in reſpect of theſe Oppoſites I need not, yet in other reſpects I am not unwilling to note ſomevvhat more hereabout, leaving it ſtill to myne ovvn &amp; others further conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as shalbe found moſt agreable to the word of God, and to his vvork, by the event of things alreadie done and yet further to

be accomplished.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> properly taken, is uſually meant the Temple that was at Ieruſalem. And this (vve haue heard) did primarily figure out Chriſt, and ſecondarily the Church, both the catholick and univerſall, &amp; particular Churches likewiſe. Whereunto may be annexed alſo, that it figured<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 19. <hi>vvith</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 1. <hi>and</hi> 6, 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 5. <hi>&amp; ſo may here alſo, in</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4.</note> particular Chriſtians, and (in ſeverall reſpects) both their bodies and their ſoules and conſciences. Moreover in that Temple at Ieruſalem, there vvas the Courts, the holy place, and the moſt holy place. Which ſometimes all of them together, ſometimes ſome of them more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly are called the Temple. And ſo this word is diverſely uſed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, as I haue shevved<note n="‘" place="margin">

               <p>The Temple at Ieruſalem was deſtroyed long ſince: and in the new Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem (which we expect clearly &amp; shortly to come at the converſion of the Ievves to the Chriſtian faith) there is no ſuch Temple to be looked for: the ſacrifices, shadovves, and ceremonies of the Law being now ceaſed. <hi>I ſaw no Temple therein</hi> (ſaith Iohn) <hi>for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lambe, are the Temple of it.

So vve may firſt cashier Bellarmines expoſition: And then M.A. vvhich is (in ſome reſpects) a great deal more ſtraunge, that by the Temple of God the Apoſtle should meane the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Sathan, the Temple of Antichriſt and the Divell, &amp;c. Againſt vvhich, if there vvere neyther other Scripture, nor any other thing at all, but that the Apoſtle here deſcribeth it by this Name of the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> &amp; calleth Antichriſts ſitting therein as God,<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>a myſterie of iniquity,</hi> it vvere ynough to teach us to adviſe well, and to take far more heed thereabout. For is this terme of the Temple of God, ever ſo taken in the Scripture? Would the Apoſtle (ſaith Auguſtine) call the Temple of an idoll or of the Divell, the <hi>Temple of God?</hi> Or when he deſcribeth the myſterie of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts iniquity, would he teach the Church, that the place of his ſitting is the Temple of God, if he meant that it vvere in deed the Synagogue of Sathan &amp; the Temple of Antichriſt? For that Antichriſt should ſit in the Temple of Antichriſt; and Synagogue of Sathan, what myſterie is there in it? All the world would eaſily perceiue, that theſe agreed very vvell, and moſt fitly together. But for Antichriſt to ſit in Gods Temple and Chriſts Church, this is in deed <hi>a myſterie,</hi> and <hi>a myſterie of iniquity:</hi> ſuch as men had
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:8260:79"/>
need open the eyes of their underſtanding, and ſet their hearts religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſider it, if they vvould diſcerne it, as it is. Which may ſufficiently appeare by theſe ſtraunge expoſitions, and like erroneous courſes, found among the Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, theſe men, and other ſuch, vvhether Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly or Anabaptiſtically addicted hereabout.</p>
               <p>And what may we think is it that induceth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereunto? Is it not firſt, that this is a myſterie of iniquitie, which eyther is not readily perceived, or not rightly eſteemed, as it should? Is it not vvithall in the Papiſts, that they would turn away the application of this Scripture from the Pope &amp; church of Rome: and therefore vvould ſend us to the Temple of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, to find out this myſterie there? Is it not alſo (on another hand) in theſe men vvith the Anabaptiſts and others like mynded, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure that the Church of Rome should any way be eſteemed the Church of God: and therefore wil rather by the <hi>Temple of God</hi> underſtand the Synagogue of Sathan, and Temple of Antichriſt, then they vvil admit that the church of Rome, should be the Temple and church of God.</p>
               <p>For my ſelf, my purpoſe is not to plead for the corrupt and adulterate eſtate of the church of Rome, or of any degenerate churches at all: much leſſe for any impietie or iniquitie of the Man of ſinne, of Antichriſt or his hierarchie, of the corruptions, falſe worship, or ſuperſtitions of that apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie: againſt vvhich I haue heretofore many yeres in priſon, and now alſo (by the mercy of God) this twentie yeeres in exile witneſſed, and ſtil doe vvitneſſe the trueth of Chriſt, vvhat in me is, and in that meaſure as it pleaſeth him to manifeſt and vouchſafe unto me. But my purpoſe is to shew, that difference is to be put betvveen the <hi>Temple of God, where Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſitteth,</hi> and betvveen <hi>Antichriſt himſelf, who as God ſitteth therein;</hi> that ſo the cauſe of the Proteſtants in general, and ours in particular, may be kept ſound and intire both againſt the Papiſts and popish corruptions on the one hand, and againſt the Anabaptiſts and Anabaptiſtical aberrations, on the other.</p>
               <p>Now therefore to ſpeak of the church of Rome in this reſpect, &amp; how this terme is uſed: it is taken either particularly, or more generally.

And himſelf ſaith here (as the trueth is) that <hi>the Tsmple figured every particular church:</hi> and therefore alſo the particular Church of Rome. Which thing alone might ſuffice for the controverſie in hand. And that the more, becauſe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian uſurpation, oppoſition, exaltation, extent of unlavvfull juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and other ſuch corruptions, growen up ſince the firſt plantation of that church, are rather to be referred to the Bishops of that church, then to that particular church it ſelf: and doe more fitly and properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne to thoſe clauſes of the Apoſtles deſcription of Antichriſt, where he

calleth him <hi>the man of ſinne, oppoſing and exalting himſelf aboue al that is called God, or is reverend, ſitting as God, and ſhewing himſelf that he is God, &amp;c.</hi> then to this other clauſe of, <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> whereabout our queſtion is.

               <p>If it be underſtood more generally, then may it be applied to all other ſuch <hi>Chriſtian churches,</hi> as ſynce the prevayling of Antichriſt (the Pope of Rome) are come under his juriſdiction and government,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, 2.</note> and vvherein he ſitteth, or treadeth thereon, though not in his ovvne perſon in each of them, yet by his hierarchie, authoritie, uſurpation, and juriſdiction. And if we mark it alſo, we shal find that not the Pope onely, but the other hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchicall Prelates, Dioceſan, Provinciall, &amp; the like, haue the Parishes or particular churches perteyning to their juriſdictions, vvherein they ſit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not in their owne perſons, yet by their hierarchie and authority. Yea euen at Rome to this day, the Cardinals (that are next to the Pope himſelf) are all of them Presbyters or Deacons, and haue each of them their particular church or parish, whereof they are named, and vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto more particularly they doe apperteyne. Whereupon (to note it by the vvay) this may alſo be obſerved, that if there be any Bishop at this day in our ovvn countrey or otherwhere, vvho hath not his particular Church or parish, whereof he is overſeer, and whereunto he doeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly appetteyne, all ſuch are more degenerate from the auncient way &amp; order of the Primitiue Churches, then is the Pope himſelf, in this behalf. And, if the Bishops haue ſtil every one his ovvn peculiar parish &amp; church to vvhich they doe properly belong, it is a good print and footſtep of the auncient vvay, wherein the churches vvere planted at firſt by the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts: And is a point that vvill giue great light to this &amp; other queſtions, novv much controverted about the order and government of the church.</p>
               <p>Note here alſo, hovv the very things vvhich the Prelates chalenge in the particular churches under them, are juriſdiction and ordination: And that othervviſe they leaue the particular Parishes to their ovvn peculiar Miniſters, for the miniſtration of the word and Sacraments among them ordinarily. Which is obſerved in all churches &amp; by all Prelates, euen the moſt Popish, and under the Pope himſelf, unto this day. And is a point alſo that vvill giue light to the better underſtanding of the eſtate of the Prelacy, and condition of the<note n="†" place="margin">Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, &amp;c.</note> churches perteyning unto them, of what ſort ſoever.</p>
               <p>But to proceed: I am not ignorant that the termes of Dioceſan, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, Nationall, &amp; Oecumenical or univerſal churches, are alſo other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe uſed and applied: and are aſcribed to <hi>repreſentatiue Churches, to Councils, Convocations, Synodes, Courts,</hi> and the like: whereof there may be ſome uſe &amp; conſideration not unprofitable about the matter here in hand, ſo it be not otherwiſe abuſed. For vvho knoweth not that the Pope hath novv a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:8260:80"/>
long time ſit in Councils, Courts, and other Chriſtian aſſemblies, oppoſing and exalting himſelf aboue all that is called God, or that is worshipped, shevving himſelf that he is God; eſtablishing, confirming, and diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vvhat he would, ruling &amp; overruling vvhom, vvhen, &amp; as he would: yet not preſent ſtil in his own perſon, but ſometimes by his deſigned ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes, alvvaies by his uſurped povver, authoritie, and juriſdiction. But of this I vvill not inſiſt. It may ſuffice, for the point in hand, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is ſo ſet and exalted as hath ben ſaid, in the Chriſtian Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, which (I ſuppoſe) theſe men themſelues being better adviſed vvill not deny to be the Churches and Temple of God. Or if they doe, then I hope they will shevv of vvhat other church or churches they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this Scripture, and hovv that vvhich the Apoſtle teacheth in this place, is by the Man of ſinne performed in the Temple of God: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaies remembring to diſtinguish betvveen the <hi>man of ſinne</hi> himſelf, and between the <hi>Temple of God</hi> wherein he ſitteth, &amp;c. And this for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I thought to note hereabout.</p>

                  </note>Where he ſaith, <hi>if we meane a particular Church, it will not agree with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of Antichriſt, whoſe</hi> City <hi>or church is ſo great, as</hi> peoples kinreds toungues and nations <hi>doe dwell in the ſtreets thereof.

Hath the very phraſe of the Scripture ſo much light in it, as he can not endure to look upon it? Or doth he in theſe things, loue darknes more then light? Or is there no difference to be put between <hi>Antichriſts City,</hi> and <hi>Gods church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Thirdly, having this occaſion, I vvill propound ſome things here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, and leaue them further to be conſidered off: being aſſured that if the true meaning of theſe Scriptures be rightly found out, the difficultie about theſe and ſundry other matters will be far the more eaſy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as therefore he doth not diſtinguish betvveen the <hi>City,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> but here and throughout his treatiſe uſually confounds them as all one: let us obſerue and conſider of theſe things thereabout.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this City (ſpoken off in<note n="‘" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, 8.</note> the place that he alledgeth) <hi>is spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called Sodome and Egypt, where alſo our Lord vvas crucified.</hi> But the church is here called <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> or <hi>the Court vvithout the Temple,</hi> or <hi>the holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c.</hi> For which ſee 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4. and the chapter it ſelf vvhich here he citeth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11, 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this great city is not onely <hi>Sodome and Egypt spiritually,</hi> but is alſo that Sodome &amp; Egypt, <hi>where our Lord was crucified. Rev.</hi> 11, 8. Now al know, that Chriſt our Lord vvas crucified in and under the juriſdiction of the City, not of the Church of Rome. For he vvas condemned to death by
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:8260:80"/>
Pontius Pilate the Deputie of the Romane Emperour (under whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and juriſdiction now the Iewes were) and vvas crucified by the Romane ſouldjours, being delivered to the Gentiles (when yet there was no church at Rome:) as Chriſt himſelf had before told his diſciples. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27, 2, 11, 26, 27, 31, 35. <hi>with</hi> 20, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Luke</hi> 18, 31, 32, 33. <hi>and</hi> 23, 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c. Joh.</hi> 18, 28, 31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19, 1, 2, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is alſo acknowledged by this man himſelf here a litle after. <hi>Animadv. pag.</hi> 83.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this City is that, which vvas the Dragons throne, and was by the Dragon giuen to the Beaſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13, 2. vvhich this man himſelf alſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, though to another purpoſe, <hi>Animad. pag.</hi> 79. But this was the City (not the Church) of Rome. Neyther, I think, will theſe men themſelues ſay, that the Church vvas the Dragons throne, or was by the Dragon giuen to the Beaſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That this City alſo is <hi>the throne of the Beaſt,</hi> &amp; <hi>Babylon the great City,</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 16, 10, 19. <hi>and</hi> 17, <hi>&amp;</hi> 18 <hi>ch.</hi> Which, that it is to be underſtood of the city of Rome, and the dominion thereof, vvill yet appeare further by the reaſons follovving.

               <p n="5">5. That this city is <hi>the woman that ſitteth on ſeuen mountaines. Rev.</hi> 17, 9, 18. And that the City, (not the church) of Rome, is built on<note n="*" place="margin">Called, Palatinus, Capitolinus Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. That this City hath <hi>ſeuen kings,</hi> or kinds of government, whereof <hi>fiue were fallen,</hi> vvhen Iohn wrote; <hi>one was then; and the other yet to come. Rev.</hi> 17, 9, 10. Which alſo is verified in the city of Rome: where the fiue ſeverall ſorts of government by <hi>Kings, Conſuls, Dictators, Decemvirs, and Tribunes,</hi> were done &amp; ceaſed, before Iohns time: The ſixt, by <hi>Emperours,</hi> was then when he lived and wrote this: the other by <hi>Popes,</hi> vvas not yet come. But how should this be found in the church of Rome: vvhich was not before Iohns time: and therefore could not haue fiue kings, or kinds of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof then fallen, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That this city, this Babylon, this woman, is <hi>that great city which reigned over the kings of the earth,</hi> in Iohns time. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17, 18. And that not the church, but the City of Rome ſo reigned, vvhen Iohn vvrote theſe things, all doe acknovvledge.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Finally, that the Lord himſelf putteth difference betweene this <hi>City Babylon,</hi> and his people therein: foretelling that this Babylon shalbe utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burnt vvith fire, and throvvne downe with violence, ſo as it shall no more at all be found: <hi>Rev.</hi> 18, 2, 8, 9, 18, 20, 21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet then calling his people out of her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18, 4. Like as of old came to paſſe in the type here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: in Babylon of Chaldea: both for the wondrous deſolation thereof; &amp; for the calling of the Lords people out from thence. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. <hi>and</hi> 51, 1 — 60, 61 — 64. <hi>with</hi> 50, 8, <hi>and</hi> 51, 6, 45. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 48, 20. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Other moe reaſons hereabout might be obſerved out of theſe &amp; other
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8260:81"/>
Chapters of this book of the Revelation, as alſo out of other Scriptures, and the event of things, ſome vvhereof are ſynce come to paſſe, and ſome remaine yet to be performed: But theſe may ſuffice to shevv hovv need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is vvell to conſider vvhat by <hi>the great city</hi> here ſpoken off, we are to underſtand; and heedfully to diſtinguish between <hi>the church,</hi> and <hi>the city</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII, Fourthly, note here, that by <hi>the great city,</hi> is meant not onely the city it ſelf, but the vvhole Iuriſdiction, authority, and dominion thereof, how far ſoever extended. For (as<note n="‘" place="margin">M. Bright on Rev. <hi>16 19.</hi>
                  </note> one well writeth) the City is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the tovvn or piece of ground conteyned within compaſſe of the walles thereof, together with the Citizens and inhabitants, having order &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among themſelues, according to the Lavves and priviledges there had: but alſo the vvhole juriſdiction and government of the City, in all places perteyning thereunto. Which being obſerved, we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by perceiue that the <hi>ſtreets of this City</hi> reach farre, euen to all places under the juriſdiction thereof: and comprehend ſundry <hi>peoples, and kinreds, and toungues, and nations:</hi> as here is ſaid. Whereupon it is fitly compared to the great city Babylon, whoſe dominion and extent of government was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding large and great. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14, 8. <hi>and</hi> 16, 19. <hi>and</hi> 17, 5. <hi>and</hi> 18, 2, 3, 4, 7 — 21. <hi>compared with Eſa.</hi> 13, 19. <hi>and</hi> 14, 6. <hi>and</hi> 47, 5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. <hi>and</hi> 51. Neyther is it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compared to cityes, but to <hi>Egypt</hi> alſo, that was a countrey. Which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, though they haue other peculiar uſes and applications, yet may alſo be obſerved in this behalf. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, 8. And the more, ſeeing that the extent of this City is ſuch, as reached euen to Ieruſalem, <hi>where our Lord was crucified,</hi> as is noted alſo in this place. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, 8.</p>
               <p>Where yet obſerue further, that the Church of Rome being fallen into deep apoſtaſie, and having the man of ſinne ſitting therein as God, who hath that city for his throne, &amp;c. the things that are ſpoken of <hi>this city,</hi> are alſo applied to the apoſtate eſtate of that church of Rome, and the other churches that are under the juriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Prelacy of that Sea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, and of vvhatſoever <hi>people, kinred, toungue,</hi> or <hi>nation</hi> they be. Which application thereof I doe alſo acknowledge, as it is obſerved by and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vvord of God. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, 8. <hi>with Eſa.</hi> 1, 10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23, 14. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16, 2 — 46. <hi>&amp;c. and Rev.</hi> 14, 8. <hi>and</hi> 17, <hi>and</hi> 18, <hi>&amp;c. with Eſa.</hi> 21, 9. <hi>and</hi> 48, 20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. <hi>and</hi> 51, 1 — 45. <hi>&amp;c. Ezech.</hi> 16, 2 — 35, <hi>&amp;c. and</hi> 23 <hi>chap. Zach.</hi> 2, 6, 7. But shal we therefore conclude, that by <hi>the Temple of God</hi> (ſpoken off 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4.) may not be underſtood <hi>the Church of God.</hi> This is the point to be inſiſted upon: as alſo, whether we can ſoundly, and by vvarrant of the Scriptures deny the Church of Rome (though in defection) and other Churches in apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie to be the Churches of God; and not to be under his covenant; nor to haue his ſignes and ſeales thereof; nor any of his ordinances remayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among them: but that euen the Baptiſme there had is <hi>an idoll, a fiction, a lying and deceitfull ſigne, a curſed and deteſtable Sacrament.</hi> Which hath ben and yet is a great occaſion and mayne ground of Anabaptiſtrie: beſides that it hardneth the Papiſts and others in their errours much the more, when
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:8260:81"/>
the Churches themſelues, and the ordinances of God (though corrupted, yet) ſtill continued unto and among them, are not ſo acknowledged by us, as they ought to be: Neyther ſo onely, but are eyther utterly denyed and diſanulled; or ſo ſpoken and accounted off, as doth in deed neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily imply the deniall and diſanulling thereof. When the Temple of God at Ieruſalem was polluted and profaned, and that ſo exceeding ſinfully, as God gaue it up vvith Ieruſalem into the enemies hand, yet vvhenas then Nebucadnezar burnt it, the Lord tooke upon him <hi>the vengeance of his Temple</hi> vvith great ſeverity: becauſe though it vvas polluted, yet it was ſtill <hi>the Lords Temple:</hi> vvhich he accordingly should haue regarded. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50, 28, <hi>and</hi> 51, 11. Which should teach all to take heed, hovv we eſteeme and deale with the churches of God, though ſinfully polluted and profaned. If the Lord were ſo carefull of the figure: shall we think he vvill haue no regard of the figured thing: vvhich this man himſelf here acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth <hi>every particular church</hi> to be: &amp; therefore alſo the church of Rome.</p>
               <p>But now he ſaith next, that <hi>to underſtand by the Temple of God a particular Church, is not anſwerable to the Temple of God in Iſraell, which was not for one Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, but for</hi>

And may we not then apply it unto that, vvhereof it vvas a figure, and accordingly underſtand it? Or may not vve ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and apply it, as the Apoſtle doeth: vvho (as himſelf ſaith here) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it to a <hi>particular church:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 16, 17. vvith which place may be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. though that may alſo be further extended. Beſides, was not the Temple in Iſraell, for any and every Synagogue, familie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon among them? And may not we now accordingly apply it to the Churches and Chriſtians of the Gentiles? And that the more, ſeeing that then alſo it vvas for them, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the faith of Iſrael, vvhether mo or fevver? Or vvere not the Ievves, diſtributed into ſeverall and particular Synagogues: which being joyntly conſidered, vvere and might be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as one people? And are not the Chriſtians (euen thoſe among whom Antichriſt hath moſt prevayled) diſtributed likewiſe into particular chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or parishes? Which if any would (in ſome good reſpect) conſider joyntly as one people: vvho would ſtriue about it; ſo as it were not any way abuſed for maintenance of any errour againſt the trueth or vvord of God?

                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>Thirdly, here a litle before, and afterward again, he vvould perſvvade that the <hi>Temple of God vvhere Antichriſt ſitteth as God,</hi> is <hi>an Idoll like himſelf, the Temple church and body of Antichriſt, the Synagogue of Sathan, a counterfeyt, &amp;c.</hi> If then by <hi>ſitting in it as God,</hi> should be underſtood the invading and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof: the meaning should be this, that Antichriſt should invade &amp; deſtroy an Idoll like himſelf, his owne Temple church and body, the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Sathan, a counterfeyt, &amp;c. And vvere this then evill in him ſo to doe? For ſure the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of his ſinfulnes. Or think they, that Antichriſt hath done, or vvill doe thus?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>Fourthly, he ſaid alſo here before, that the <hi>Temple of God figured the church catholick, and particular.</hi> If then by ſitting in it as God, be underſtood the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading and deſtroying of it:</hi> he muſt shew vvhich of them he meaneth to be invaded and deſtroyed by Antichriſt, the one or both of them.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, though it be true, that Antichriſt invades Gods church and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes many of his people (as both experience, and the deſcription of the Beaſt, and of the man of ſinne, and the types thereof in Nebuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar and Antiochus doe manifeſt) yet here (for the point in hand) muſt be found out whether by <hi>ſitting</hi> in the Temple of God, be underſtood the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading and deſtroying thereof. And yet then alſo vvill follovv ſtill, that by the <hi>Temple of God</hi> here, muſt be underſtood <hi>Gods church and people,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:8260:84"/>
to the Temple and to Ieruſalem and the dwellers therein: which is ſtill againſt himſelf, as is noted before.</p>
               <p>And note further, that not onely Nebuchadnezar and Antiochus (ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off in the Scriptures here alledged) were types of Antichriſt: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Pharaoh, Corah, Dathan, Abiram, Saul, Abſalon, Ieroboam, Ahaz, Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jakim, the perſecuting and apoſtate Prieſts, the falſe prophets, and divers others, both in Iudah and Iſraell and othervvhere: ſome in one reſpect, ſome in another: And that therefore to diſcerne the eſtate and dealing of Antichriſt, we should not look alone at ſome one thing, type, or event; but at the many things, types, and events, that the Scripture shevveth, &amp; which time and experience hath novv already manifeſted ſundry waies, and will yet make more manifeſt hereafter, concerning this matter. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thervviſe, great difference might be obſerved in the tipes and things ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off in the Scriptures here alledged. For Ieremie ſpeaketh of Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaradan a chief captain under Nebuchadnezar the king of Babylon, how he burnt the houſe of the Lord, and the houſes of Ieruſalem, and brake dovvne the walles thereof, &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 52, 12, 13. <hi>&amp;c. Lam.</hi> 2, 7, 9. To vvhich time the 97 <hi>Pſalme</hi> alſo here alledged may be referred. Daniel ſpeaketh of Antiochus king of Syria, who magnified himſelf againſt God, took avvay the dayly ſacrifice, caſt avvay the place of Gods ſanctuarie, trode it &amp; the hoſt of God under foot, and (as it is in another place of the ſame prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) polluted the Sanctuarie of ſtrength, (or, the Sanctuarie and munition, meaning the Temple and city of Ieruſalem) and placed the abomination that maketh deſolate. So as though the Temple and City of Ieruſalem novv remayned, yet they were polluted, ſpoiled, caſt avvay, and trode un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot. <hi>Dan.</hi> 8, 11, 13. <hi>and</hi> 11, 36. <hi>with ver.</hi> 31. Beſides, the Iewes in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivitie of Babylon, acknowledge that their ſinnes deſerved it, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets alſo for their ſinnes had denounced it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9, 5 — 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79, 8, 9. <hi>with Jeremies prophecy throughout.</hi> Whereas the Iewes in the perſecution of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus, alledge their integritie and faithfull conſtancie in the vvorship &amp; ſervice of God, euen unto death, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44, 17 — 22. Albeit that divers alſo then eyther by the perſecution of Antiochus, or by his flatteries, or both, were corrupted and dealt vvickedly againſt the covenant of the Lord. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11, 32, 33, 34, 35. Wherein likevviſe there was a fit type both of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts dealing, and of the churches eſtate, in this behalf. And in all theſe times, the Iewes notvvithſtanding, vvere the church &amp; people of God; &amp; though ſome of them were ſlayne and deſtroyed, yet among them ſtill God preſerved his Church and people from the deſtruction intended by their adverſaries: Both vvhich as touching the queſtion and Scripture in hand, should carefully be obſerved.</p>
               <p>Finally, this Scripture is ſo to be underſtood, as it may not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict but agree with that which is written, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, 2, 3. where <hi>the Court of the Temple is giuen to the Gentiles, and the holy City trode upon, two and fourty moneths;</hi> (whether this be underſtood<note n="†" place="margin">Reſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling the times of Eliah, of Antiochus of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Phariſees, &amp;c.</note> of shorter or longer times, which yet should haue an end, or (vvith <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>of</hi> 1260 <hi>yeeres,</hi> putting a day for a

yere. And afterward <hi>the Temple of God is opened in heauen, and therein is ſeen the Ark of his Teſtament,</hi> or covenant, &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, 19. <hi>and</hi> 14, 15, 17. <hi>and</hi> 15, 5, 6, 8. <hi>and</hi> 16, 1. And God hath <hi>his people</hi> ſtil in Babylon. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18, 4. So Gods church and people then remayne ſtill undeſtroyed, notvvithſtanding all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and exaltation of the Man of ſinne, with all his tyranny, cruelty, and perſecution, had in over and againſt the church and people of God, from time to time, untill himſelf (being the ſonne of perdition) come to be conſumed and deſtroyed in the end.</p>
               <p>Othervviſe alſo the Anabaptiſts plea should here againe be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who hold<note n="†" place="margin">M.S. cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract. of the Beaſt. p. <hi>56</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>that Antichriſt hath utterly deſtroyed the true Temple, the true church; and hath aboliſhed the true baptiſme of Chriſt: and that therefore they muſt reare up a new church, and get themſelues a new baptiſme, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo they proceed from one errour and evill to another. Wherein this mans erroneous opinions and corrupt gloſes may harden them much the more. And hitherto of the firſt expoſition of the vvords aforeſaid, that here is giuen.</p>
               <p>His other expoſition is, that vvhen the Apoſtle ſaith, Antichriſt <hi>ſitteth as God in the Temple of God,</hi> it is to be underſtood of their <hi>owne vaine oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vvhiles they vvill haue</hi>
                  <note n="‘" place="margin">Doth he meane the church of Rome? or vvhat els speaketh he off.</note> 
                  <hi>it</hi> (what I pray you) <hi>called the Chriſtian catholick church, and the Pope the head of the ſame.</hi> Firſt I ask, vvhereof he ſpeaketh this, that they vvill haue <hi>it ſo called.?</hi> If of <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> himſelf in his very laſt vvords, told us, that by <hi>it</hi> is underſtood <hi>Gods church &amp; people</hi> in deed. If he ſpeak of ſome other thing, he ſpeaketh not to the point in hand. And beſides vvhat is it, that he ſpeaketh off? And why doeth he not name it? Is it becauſe if ſo he did, his expoſition vvould be found eyther contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie to the former, or ſome other way to no purpoſe at all, but againſt himſelf?</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the Apoſtle had meant that it vvas not the temple of God in deed, but onely that they would haue it ſo called: could he not ſo haue expreſſed his mynd for this clauſe of <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> as he doeth in the next vvords touching Antichriſt himſelf, vvhen he ſaith, <hi>he ſhevveth himſelf</hi> or pretendeth <hi>that he is God:</hi> and as the Scripture ſpeaketh othervvhere, vvhen it noteth <hi>the blasphemie of them, which ſay they are Jewes, &amp; are not, but are the Synagogue of Sathan, and ſo doe lye. Rev.</hi> 2, 9. <hi>and</hi> 3, 9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if it be thus to be underſtood, as now he ſaith, that it is not the Temple of God in deed, but onely that <hi>they vvill haue it ſo called in vain oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, making the Pope the head thereof:</hi> then (beſides his ſtrengthning again of the Anabaptiſts opinion aforeſaid) his owne former expoſition here giuen, can not ſtand, vvhere he ſaid (in the laſt vvords before) that it is to be underſtood of <hi>Gods church and people invaded and deſtroyed by Antichriſt, as Jeruſalem and the dvvellers therein were dealt vvith by the heathens of old.</hi> For theſe were in deed the church and people of God (though ſinfully corrupted) &amp; not onely in their owne vaine oſtentation, that they vvould be ſo called.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, many often boaſt vainly of that, vvhich notvvithſtanding they haue or may haue in deed, but yet abuſe it or vvalk not worthy thereof: as I shevved<note n="‘" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 106. 107.</note> heretofore, by the example of the Ievves here ſpoken off,

out of <hi>Eſa.</hi> 48, 1, 2. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3, 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3, 9. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8, 37, 39. as likevviſe the church of Rome hath a long time boaſted, that it is the church of God, and as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther churches and people alſo doe, vvhen yet they abuſe and vvalk not vvorthy of that mercy of God unto them. Beſides that Lucifer the king of Babylons vain boaſting of <hi>his ſitting on the mount of the Congregation, &amp;c.</hi> did not hinder, but that it vvas in deed the Temple of God, and the Mount of the congregation in the ſides of the North, &amp;c. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 14, 13. Other things here I omitt, as being meerly vaine in deed: that <hi>a particular church ſhould challenge to be the catholick church</hi> (vvhich cannot be, as they underſtand it) <hi>&amp; the Pope to be the head of the ſame:</hi> vvhich Chriſt onely is, and no other can be, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1, 22, 23. Let theſe clauſes therefore &amp; all by-matters be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that perteyn not to the point in hand, &amp; let the thing be ſimply pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as it should be, thus, <hi>vvhether the church of Rome and other churches be Chriſtian churches, or not:</hi> and then let all conſider thereof indifferently, that ſo the trueth may be found out according to the vvord of God, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver other opinions or prejudice vve haue had to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie heretofore. And hitherto of theſe expoſitions of this Scripture.</p>
               <p>Next, whereas upon the underſtanding of this Scripture aforeſaid, I brought in tvvo conſequences: shevving hovv it would meet vvith and convince the errors both of the Papiſts and Anabaptiſts, &amp;c. this Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſetteth himſelf to withſtand in both, what he can. The firſt was this, that <hi>by the Temple of God</hi> (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4.) <hi>underſtanding the church of God, it vvil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv, that Antichriſt ſhould ſit in the church of God, and is there to be ſought &amp; found, and not among the Ievves, Turks, Pagans, and the like, as the Papiſts and others vvould perſwade us:</hi> To this he oppoſeth, ſaying, <hi>it is a fallacie from an inſufficient divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> becauſe <hi>all out of the true church are not Ievves, or Turks, or Pagans,</hi> but there is <hi>a fourth to make up the meaſe, euen</hi> popish Antichriſtians, <hi>among whom the man of ſinne is to be found, &amp;c.</hi> Where (omitting, that he ſetteth not down all my vvords) firſt I obſerue, that now he maketh the <hi>Popiſh Antichriſtians</hi> to be the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> vvhere Antichriſt is to be found: and but erewhile he told us, that by the <hi>Temple of God, vvhere Antichriſt ſitteth as God,</hi> is to be underſtood <hi>Gods church and people invaded and deſtroyed by Antichriſt.</hi> So as eyther he thinketh the popish Antichriſtians to be Gods church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: or els he forgetteth and contradicteth himſelf extreemely.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let him tell us, vvhether the popish Antichriſtians, of whom he ſpeaketh, be Chriſtians, &amp; in the church of God, or not. If he ſay, they are Chriſtians, and in the church of God, he giveth us the cauſe, and doth but uſe fallacie to deceiue the ſimple, by the terme of <hi>popiſh Antichriſtians:</hi> our queſtion now being of the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> vvhere Antichriſt ſitteth: and ſo of fynding him there, among<note n="†" place="margin">How in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, they are or may be termed popiſh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtians or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I doe not here ſtand upon.</note> Chriſtians, and not among the Ievves, Turks, Pagans, and the like. If he ſay, they are not Chriſtians, nor in the church of God: hovv then will he shevv that Antichriſt is to be ſought &amp; found among them, ſeing he is to be ſought and found in the <hi>Temple of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I aske vvhen and vvhere thoſe <hi>popiſh Antichriſtians</hi> begun &amp; yet
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:8260:86"/>
are, of vvhom he ſpeaketh? Alſo, whether they vvere popish Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and not the churches of God, before Antichriſt invaded and ſate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, or became to be ſuch aftervvard. If he ſay, they were ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let him tell us vvho they vvere, and shevv that ſuch then was their eſtate. If he ſay, they became ſo aftervvard, let him then tel us, what they vvere before, whether Chriſtians and the church of God, or not: &amp; how long it vvas aftervvard, ere they ceaſed ſo to be: and vvho they are, of whom thus he ſpeaketh: remembring ſtill to diſtinguish betvveen <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Temple of God</hi> vvhere he ſitteth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let him remember, how yll he took it, when M. Sm. (ſpeaking of <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, 2.) applied the Court of the Temple, to the aſſemblies of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. Which interpretation then he called<note n="‘" place="margin">
                     <hi>Def. of Scrip. p.</hi> 12 13, 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>impietie, dotage, his fancie, blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of heart, abuſe of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ord of God, &amp;c.</hi> If he could not endure, that he should ſo interpret <hi>the court of the Temple,</hi> (ſpoken of by Iohn) how is it that now himſelf thus expounds the <hi>Temple of God</hi> (ſpoken of by Paul) to be <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Antichriſtians?</hi> If it were then impietie, dotage, a fancie, blyndnes, and abuſe of Gods word, ſo to expound &amp; apply it, what thinks he it is novv?</p>
               <p>Fiftly, where he ſaith further, that <hi>in the true church Antichriſt the man of ſin hath ſometimes ben found raunging as a wolf, but not reigning as a God, which in his own Temple he doeth:</hi> Firſt I aske, what <hi>true church</hi> it is, whereof thus he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that the man of ſinne Antichriſt hath ben found raunging therein as a wolf. Secondly, note how now he underſtands <hi>ſitting as God,</hi> to be reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a God: vvhich here before he underſtood to be invading and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying. Thirdly, how that vvhich the Apoſtle calleth the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> he ſtil calleth the <hi>Temple of the man of ſinne, Antichriſts ovvn Temple, &amp;c.</hi> Where in, vvhether he doe not uſe fallacie, let himſelf conſider, &amp; others judge.</p>
               <p>Finally, touching this Scripture, &amp; this clauſe thereof, how ever he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne what we propound, let him yet obſerue how others doe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and apply it. Whereof I will here giue but one inſtance. More may be produced hereafter. M. Calvin vvriting upon theſe vvords, <hi>in the Temple of God,</hi> noteth this:<note n="‘" place="margin">
                     <hi>Calv. in</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ</hi> 2, 4.</note> By this one vvord is their errour, yea their ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishnes, ſufficiently refuted, who doe therefore account the Pope to be the Vicar of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath his fear in the church, howſoever he cary himſelf. For Paul placeth Antichriſt no other vvhere, then in the very Sanctuarie of God. For he is no outward enemie, but an home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred or houſehold enemy, which under the very name of Chriſt oppugneth Chriſt. But it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, how a denne of ſo many ſuperſtitions may be called the church, which ought to be the pillar of trueth. I anſwer that ſo it is called, not becauſe it reteyneth all the qualities of the church, but becauſe it hath ſomewhat remayning. Therefore I acknowledge it to be the Temple of God, wherein the Pope ruleth, but profaned with innumerable ſacriledges. Calv. in 2 Theſ. 2.4. And thus doe other the beſt vvriters both old and new underſtand this Scripture, of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> So as his oppoſition is not onely againſt us, but in deed againſt the beſt vvriters in all ages. And hitherto of the firſt conſequence, which I inferred upon the underſtanding of this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture aforeſaid, vvhich more ſpecially concerneth the Papiſts, and others likewiſe mynded thereabout.</p>
               <p>Another conſequence alſo I inferred upon the ſame ground againſt the Anabaptiſts and ſuch as incline unto them herein: Namely, that by the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8260:86"/>
                  <hi>Temple of God</hi> (ſpoken off 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4.) <hi>underſtanding the church of God, it wil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv, that Antichriſt ſhould ſit in the church of God, and that therefore he is there to be found, and doth not wholly take avvay the church of God, &amp; every truth &amp; ordinance of the Lord, as Anabaptiſts, and ſuch as are herein Anabaptiſtically inclined, would bear us in hand.</hi> To this he anſwereth, <hi>Neyther did the Divel take away vvholly every trueth and ordinance of God from among the heathens: but they reteyned many rites of Gods worſhip received from their Fathers, as</hi>
                  <note n="‘" place="margin">Animad. p. <hi>70.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>before is noted.</hi> But vvhy now ſaith he not that the Divell took not away vvholly the <hi>church of God</hi> from among the heathens? Why leaveth he out this clauſe, vvhich he ſavv I mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about Antichriſt, that he takes not away wholly the <hi>church of God,</hi> &amp;c. Is it becauſe he can fynd no anſwer, and yet vvill not yeeld to the trueth: and therefore rather then he vvill not oppoſe, uſeth theſe shifts and ſlye conveyances: thinking that his followers vvil not obſerue theſe ſleights of his. Hovv ever it be, let the reader obſerue, that himſelf ſeeth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens haue not the <hi>church of God,</hi> as the church of Rome, vvhere Antichriſt ſitteth hath: and that therefore fetching his anſwer from the heathens, he doth vvholly leaue out this clauſe of <hi>the Church of God,</hi> which they haue not among them in their eſtate: and ſo in deed giues us the cauſe, whiles he would ſeem to oppugne it.</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſaith, the <hi>Divel hath not taken avvay vvholly every trueth &amp; ordinance of God among the heathens:</hi> it is nothing to the purpoſe, ſeing they are not the church and people of God, under his covenant: neyther doe ſo enjoy any of them. Take an inſtance in one of the particulars which he mentioned before, where he ſaid, that <hi>the heathens reteyne baptiſmes or waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings among them:</hi> yet vvhen any of them leaue that eſtate, and come to the faith and church of Chriſt, they are to be baptized into the Lords name, and to receiue the ſeale of his covenant giuen to his church, vvhich they had not before. But ſo may not be done, vvith thoſe that haue received baptiſme in the church of Rome, or any other apoſtate churches, when they leaue ſuch eſtate: becauſe they are already baptized into the name of Chriſt, and haue in thoſe Churches received the ſeale of Gods cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which the heathens haue not: As I haue shewed<note n="‘" place="margin">Pag. <hi>27,</hi> &amp;c.</note> here before more particularly. And this is alwaies a ſure ground and firme rule to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <hi>The Lord ſhevveth his vvord unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and his judgements unto Iſrael: He hath not dealt ſo vvith any nation: and as for his judgements, they haue not knovven them. Pſal.</hi> 147, 19, 20. That which (he ſaith) he noted here before, is<note n="”" place="margin">Pag. <hi>94,</hi> &amp;c.</note> before anſvvered: vvhither I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>And vvhere he ſaith next, that the <hi>Divel and Antichriſt, ſo much as in them lay, and as ſtood vvith the ſafetie of their deceitfull kingdome, haue ſought wholly to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay the church and trueth of God, and to put lyes in the place:</hi> this is againſt him ſelf: both implying that it vvas not vvholly done (which is the thing that vve ſay, and he oppugneth) and manifeſtly shevving that Gods goodnes and power ſuperabounded aboue all the malice and iniquitie of the <hi>Divell and Antichriſt:</hi> vvhich therefore vve should all obſerue vvith thankfulnes to God, &amp; not obſcure or oppugne, as the Anabaptiſts &amp; this man doth,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:8260:87"/>
what they can. Beſides that Gods goodnes and power did yet more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, in nourishing the vvoman (his church) in the vvildernes, from the preſence of the ſerpent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12, 14.

                  <p>So then note here theſe particulars, concerning the point in hand. 1, That the <hi>people of God</hi> pollute his Temple, become apoſtates and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and are captived in <hi>Babylon.</hi> 2. That thus now <hi>Sion</hi> is in Babylon; &amp; conſequently the Temple of God (ſo to ſpeak) the people of God the church of God, is in Babylon. 3.

                  <p>Neyther vvill I enter to ſpeak of other things, that might here be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: As namely, that he uſeth the terme of <hi>the church of Babylon</hi> (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Babylon in Chaldea) vvhen eyther he meaneth the City of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, or ſpeaketh not according to the Prophets ſpeach here: but in deed uſeth colourable vvords to deceiue the Reader: as if now there had ben ſome other church of Babylon, beſides the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the people of God, here ſpoken off. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51, 45.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, that here he calleth <hi>the Iſraelites, Gods loſt ſheep ſcattered there, upon the mountaines and hils, whom firſt the king of Aſhur had devoured, &amp;c.</hi> vvhich may be referred not onely to Iudah, but to Iſrael alſo of the ten tribes: as may appear, by the Prophets words, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.4, 17, 18, 19, 20. compared with 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 15, 19, 20, 29. <hi>and</hi> 17, 3, 4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So here then he acknowledgeth Iſraell to be <hi>Gods loſt ſheep,</hi> aſvvell as Iudah: vvhom<note n="‘" place="margin">Animad. p. <hi>82.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And moreover, that he ſaith <hi>God vvill receiue them into covenant, whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out of Babylon,</hi>
                     <note n="”" place="margin">

The Iewes themſelues knew better, when they vvere in Babylon, and thereupon grounded their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts to the Lord, and prayed, ſaying, O <hi>Lord why haſt thou made us to erre from thy wayes, and hardened our heart from thy feare? Returne for thy ſervants ſake, the tribes of thyne inheritance. The people of thyne holynes haue poſseſſed the land but a litle vvhile: our adverſaries haue troden downe thy Sanctuarie.

and we all are the work of thyne hand. Be not wroth verie ſore,</hi> O <hi>Lord, neyther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member iniquitie for ever: behold, ſee vve beſeech thee, vve are all thy people. &amp;c. Eſa.</hi> 64, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and the like things I omit further to treat off. That which is ſaid already, is ynough to cleare the matter ſufficiently. But ſeeing there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference here to the alledging of ‘ this Scripture before; where alſo I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon theſe words <hi>(My people,)</hi> about the Baptiſme had in the church of Rome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is a point or two of vvaight to be obſerved therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, vvhich being not ſpoken off before, and fitly perteyning to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter novv in hand, I can not therefore omit here briefly to touch them. Thus then it is: Among other reaſons touching the baptiſme aforeſaid, I uſed this:</p>
                  <p>The Baptiſme had in apoſtate churches eyther is a ſeale of the covenant of God, or not. If it be a ſeale of the Lords covenant, then ſure it is true baptiſme. If it be not, then ſee what great things will follow thereupon: As firſt, that they which haue no other baptiſme but it,<note n="†" place="margin">This clauſe he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth over, in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadv. p. <hi>71.</hi>
                     </note> haue not the outward baptiſme that ſealeth unto them the covenant of God: and therefore muſt with the Anabaptiſts get another, that they may be aſſured they haue the ſeal of Gods covenant of grace and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that there neyther haue ben nor shall be in Babylon any of Gods people under his covenant: which is contrarie to that is written, Rev. 18.4. where the Lord sheweth that he hath his people, whom by the words of his covenant he calleth thence, ſaying, Come out of her, my people, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="margin">This alſo he neyther mentioneth nor anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</note> And if theſe men wil ſay, that themſelues are not of ſuch people there ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, then let them tell us, vvhen and how they came under the covenant of God: and let them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo shevv it without ſtablishing their ovvne righteouſnes of works thereby.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that the baptiſme now had in apoſtate Churches is not anſvverable to the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had in the apoſtaſie of Iſraell: For that circumciſion (though had in apoſtaſie) was true cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,<note n="”" place="margin">All this which here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovveth to the end, he includeth in an <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> and a ſeale of the Lords covenant, to his people, and therefore needed not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced or repeated. But the Baptiſme now had in the apoſtaſie of the church of Rome, they ſay is not true baptiſme, and ſo not a ſeale of the Lords covenant to his people now, as the other was then: therefore it muſt be renounced, and another that is true obteyned. And thus againe in this they make themſelues (and would make us) ſtraungers from the policie of Iſraell, as in the point of government alſo was obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Neyther will it now help them to alledge thoſe Scriptures, or the like, as we haue produced heretofore againſt the Anabaptiſts, to approue the reteyning of our baptiſme had in Apoſtaſie, without renunciation or repetition thereof: as namely, 2 Chron. 30 ch. compared with Exo. 12, 48, 49. Gen. 17.10— 13. Levit. 26.14 — 44, 45, 46. Deut. 4, 25 — 31. 2 King. 9, 6. and 13, 23. Pſal. 78, 9 — 38. and 89.30— 34. Ezech. 16.44 — 63. &amp; 43, 7, 8, 9. 2 Theſ. 2.3 — 8. Rom. 11, 2 — 5. &amp; 15.4. &amp;c. For now it will be anſwered them, that in Iſraels apoſtaſie they kept circumciſion, which needed not be repeated, ſeeing it vvas true, and ſealed Gods covenant unto them: but that theſe cannot ſo plead for the baptiſme had in the apoſtaſie of Rome, becauſe themſelues ſay, the baptiſme of the church of Rome is not true baptiſme, and ſo not the ſeale of Gods covenant to them which haue no other but it. Whereunto what they will anſwer, let them bethink themſelues. And let them shew us, by what Scriptures they can approue their ſtanding novv, who wittingly &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly remayne without true baptiſme, to ſeale unto them the covenant of God in Ieſus Chriſt. Advertiſ. pag. 56, 57,</p>
                  <p>This was part of my anſvver to theſe mens Articles concerning this matter. Whereunto vvhat anſwer this Oppoſite returneth again, may be ſeen in his Animadver. <hi>pag.</hi> 71, 72. Where novv by this occaſion I thought it not amiſſe, here to vvish the reader to obſerue, how this man being not able ſoundly to anſwer theſe particulars, shifts ſo about them (after his manner) as ſome of them he neyther mentioneth nor offereth to anſwer at all, though they be ſpeciall points of vvaight, vvhich should not be omitted, neyther vvould be, if he could finde anſwer thereunto. For
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:8260:89"/>
example, this for one, <hi>If the baptiſme had in apoſtate Churches be not a ſeale of the covenant of God, then they which haue no other baptiſme but it, haue not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward baptiſme that ſealeth unto them the covenant of God, and therefore &amp;c.</hi> And this for another, <hi>That if God haue not novv his people, that are under his covenant (though yet remayning in Babylon) and that themſelues alſo were ſuch heretofore, as there are spoken off, that then they would tell us,</hi> when, <hi>and</hi> hovv <hi>they came under the covenant of God: and ſhevv it alſo without ſtabliſhing their ovvn righteouſnes of works thereby.</hi> Whereunto let the Reader ſee, if he giue any word of anſwer, but paſſeth it by, both unmentioned and unanſvvered. Other ſuch things let the Reader himſelf obſerue here and other vvhere. And now that by this occaſion I manifeſt theſe shifts and ſleights of his: let his follovvers get of him (if they can) a ſound anſvver to theſe particulars hereabout.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Seeing he denyeth the baptiſme had in apoſtate churches, to be the ſeale of Gods covenant: that therefore he would shew, <hi>when</hi> &amp; <hi>where</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and they received an outvvard baptiſme, that ſealeth Gods covenant unto them, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he vvould shevv, vvhether they were under the covenant of God, before they vvere baptiſed; or came under it ſince. If before, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then both their parents and themſelues were not under the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, vvhich the Lord hath continued in apoſtate churches, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the defection thereof. If ſince, <hi>vvhen</hi> &amp; <hi>hovv</hi> they came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the covenant of God: And <hi>vvhere</hi> they received baptiſme, (the Lords ſigne of entrance into his covenant) ſynce they came under it: Or vvhere ever they find in the Scriptures, that God ordeyned that men should firſt be baptized, afore they be under his covenant: Or that the people of God haue ſo vvalked, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seeing he yeeldeth not, that novv there are in Babylon <hi>the people of God,</hi> under <hi>his covenant;</hi> nor that themſelues are ſuch, vvhom the Lord hath called from thence: let him moreover in this reſpect tell both vvhen &amp; hovv they came under the covenant of God: and let him shewe it alſo without ſtablishing their ovvne righteouſnes of vvorks thereby: like as the Anabaptiſts doe, in this behalf.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That he ſpeak novv alſo (being better adviſed then heretofore) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Baptiſme received in the Church of Rome and other apoſtate Churches, be anſwerable to the circumciſion had in the apoſtaſie of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, yea &amp; of Iudah alſo. And vvhether that Circumciſion then were not, and this Baptiſme novv be not, the Lords ſigne and ſeale of his covenant of grace, &amp;c. Or if not, hovv then they can eyther ſoundly anſwer the Anabaptiſts; or conſcionably approue their own ſtanding, vvho witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vvillingly remayne without the Lords ſigne of true Baptiſme out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly received, to ſeal unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods covenant of grace in Ieſus Chriſt: And finally, hovv they can come to the Lords table, without the Lords ſigne of Baptiſme firſt outvvardly had, but that they muſt needs fall into high tranſgreſſion againſt God; and profanation of his holy things; to the provoking of his vvrath againſt them more and more, til they repent
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:8260:89"/>
and amend their vvaies. And that alſo the more, ſeeing they haue had ſo long and often vvarning thereof giuen unto them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things (if they can) let them get him to anſwer by the word of God, ſyncerely and ſoundly; if they vvill vvalk conſcionably herein, as they ought to doe. To us, they may ſee, he cannot anſwer them: but with ſleights &amp; evaſions puts them of: perſvvading the Reader that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is proved by us, vvhen any may ſee that nothing in deed is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by himſelf: but that ſometimes he paſſeth by things vvholly vvhich should ſpecially be inſiſted on and anſwered; ſometimes where he would anſvver, cannot find any, but vvith gloſing ſpeaches caryes away the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vvhat he can; and ſometimes brings that (as he thinketh) againſt us, vvhich (being well obſerved) is in deed for us, and againſt himſelf. As may be ſeen in the laſt points novv treated off: beſides the like in other here noted before, and that may be obſerved throughout his treatiſe.</p>

condemned not onely of adulterie, but of theft. And note moreover, that when a thief repenteth, he may not keep but muſt reſtore againe all the goods he hath ſtollen.

The Church is of thoſe things, which haue one name, and divers ſignifications, or, where divers things are ſignified by one word: which cannot be comprehended in one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and generall definition. 2.

                     </gap>. Now of each of theſe we will conſider ſo briefly as we can]</p>
                  <p>The Church of Rome when it is conſidered as a ſubject, it hath two parts, the paſtors and the flock of Chriſt: for which church the Apoſtle of old gaue thanks to God by Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe her faith was published throughout the whole world. Rom. 1, 8. [And for which we alſo dayly ask of God in our prayers, that he would informe it to worship him by his ſpirit in the Goſpell of his ſonne, &amp; to ſtablish it in the faith.] Neither doe we deny this ſubject to be euen at Rome, [by the mercy of God,] at this day, becauſe we truſt there is God calling, perſons called, &amp; the calling it ſelf yet in her: the meeting of which things together in one giveth being to a church, as before we shevved.</p>
                  <p>But touching the papacie, or the papall hierarchie, which they are woont to call Eccleſiaſtical, we ſay that it is not the church properly, but an accident growen unto the church, and ſuch as covertly worketh againſt the life, and health of the church. [That it is not the church properly,<note place="margin">Here again he omits clauſes, words &amp; paſſages of speciall waight.</note> is proved by the very definition of the papacie, and of the church of God.] For the papacie [ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his generall] is an order: [the church is a companie or an aſſemblie. The papacie by his difference, is an order poſitiue,] humane or from men, and naught: The church is an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie divine or from God, [by divine authoritie united together vvith reaſon. Now thoſe things which differ both in their generall, and in their eſſential difference, and in their neceſſarie condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or properties, they cannot be one and the ſame thing. And that the papacie is an accident growen upon the church, experience it ſelf ſpeaketh. For the ſubject is before his accident, which is contingent and ſeparable: The church was many ages when the papacie was not: The papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie came to the church contingently (beſide the being of the church,) and ſo may be ſeparated from it, as at this time alſo there are churches where the papacie is not, &amp; there will be churches ſtill hereafter vvithout the papacie. Therefore the papacie is not the church, but it is an evill growen up in the church, a peſtilence, a dropſie, a gangrene in the bodie, deceitfully working a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the life and health of it, and therefore moſt dangerouſly &amp; noyſomely eating up the liuely and wholeſome moyſture of the church. But of this whole matter we haue ſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en in the third controverſie, and in this fourth we are to ſpeak of it hereafter.]</p>
                  <p>[Therefore concerning the other which remaineth let us ſe, whether the papal Roman church,<note place="margin">This alſo he paſseth by.</note> or that which is of the pope, be the church. The opinions which are about this matter are divers. The popish generation cry out with full mouth, that it is abſolutely the church. Others not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding a different regard of the papacy, from that which is the church, deny it to be the church. We relying both on the nature of the thing, and on the authoritie of the Scripture, doe put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. The nature of the thing doth teach, that the church is one thing, and that the papacie is another, as we ſpake a litle before. The authoritie of the Scripture teacheth the church, but it teacheth not the papacie: therefore they are divers things. For they delude undoubtedly, I ſay they delude, which require at our hands one definition of the ſubject &amp; of the accident, as of one ſingular thing, or obtrude it on us. For thus muſt we ſay, The papal church, as it hath that in it which belongeth to the definition of a church, it is a church: but as it hath in it the evill growen unto it, which we call the papacie, in that reſpect it is not a church, but a faultie or defloured, a polluted and corrupt church, and drawing on to deſtruction.]</p>

is a body that is ſvvolne with the vvater, cauſing the dropſie. Both are together, and yet ſo toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as eyther one of the two, or both together muſt needs perish. If the nature of the body be ſtronger, the conſumption ceaſeth and the dropſie-water decayeth: but if the conſumption or dropſie prevaile, there is moſt certain deſtruction of them both. So is the church of God: for in it ſelf it is the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt. If a deadly diſeaſe growe upon it, both are then together, the body and the diſeaſe in the body. If the purging medicine of the grace of God (for nothing is here naturall, be of the more efficacie, the diſeaſe then is vanquished and decayeth: but if the diſeaſe prevaile, then both of them (the body &amp; the diſeaſe) muſt needs come to an end. For ſuch is the condition of the diſeaſe: it both feedeth it ſelf on the body decaying, and deſtroyeth it ſelf together with the body.]</p>

                     <note place="margin">And this alſo.</note>[After this maner therefore doe we eſteem of the church of Rome, which they cal the papal or popish church.

If God shal giue it the purging medicine of his grace, by meanes whereof the papacie, the accidentarie evil decay and perish, it is wel: but if the papacie, that moſt faultie and corrupt order, and deadly accident prevaile, it wil bring deſtruction to both of them, both to the church and to it ſelf, by the judgment of God.]</p>

                  <p>[Wherefore in my judgment they ſpeak prepoſterouſly, who ask whether the church be in the papacie:<note place="margin">And theſe clauſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</note> becauſe on the contrarie it should be asked, whether the papacie be in the church.

And that] the papacie is in the church, as the order or eſtate of apoſtaſie in the houſe and city of God, [is as certaine, as that of the Apoſtle is certain,] 2 Theſ. 2. that the man of ſinne, the ſonne of perdition ſitteth in the temple of God, with his whole order or<note n="‘" place="margin">Or, <hi>rank,</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation.</note> eſtate of apoſtates: &amp; not [on the other ſide, that] the temple of God conſiſteth in that order and number of apoſtates, which is a thing moſt ſtraunge &amp; furtheſt off. But the terme of the papacie taken doubly &amp; aequivocally, deceiveth them in ſuch ſort, as here before we shewed concerning the Romane popish church. For under the name of the papacie (which is an order vitious &amp; corrupt) they comprehend the ſubject it ſelf, which is annoyed with that corruption, not diſtinguishing aright between theſe things.]</p>
                  <p>[As therefore, if any should deny that to be a bodie,] which lyeth in a deadly ſort ſwollen with the water of the dropſie,<note place="margin">And this.</note> [or should affirme that water vvhich choketh the body, to be the body it ſelf, should in both theſe be deceived in his judgment: ſo alſo are both deceived, as well they which deny it to be the church, becauſe the papacie is in it, as they which avouch the papacie to be the church it ſelf, which vve haue before diſproved.] The papacie is a poyſon in the church, which poyſon muſt needs be vomited out, if it will be preſerved: or els the church vvilbe extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by it, if it ſuffer that poyſon to prevaile, and poſſeſſe all the veynes of the bodie.</p>
                  <p>[But how can she be the church, (will ſome ſay in which the papacie is? Euen ſo as there is the body,<note place="margin">And this.</note> in which a diſeaſe worketh. But becauſe the papacie is a deadly corruption, the more that the papacie getteth ſtrength, the more the church is weakned: the increaſe of the one, is the decreaſe of the other. And hence it commeth to paſſe, that in the churches which are called po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish, ſome are more healthie, and ſome more unhealthie then others: the more healthie are thoſe which haue leſſe of the papacie, and more of the church: and thoſe are the more unhealthie which haue more of the papacie, and leſſe of the church: &amp; of this kind, I doubt not that church to be, which at this day is at Rome.] For it had long agoe giuen up the ghoſt, if God by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of his grace and long ſuffring had not nourished and kept it warme.</p>
                  <p>[Notwithſtanding that we may giue content unto their minds, which doe not yet reach unto theſe things,<note place="margin">And this.</note> or think that they are more ſubtily then truly ſpoken of the church which they call
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:8260:96"/>
the papal or popish church: let us anſwer this queſtion in few words, from the regard of al parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular churches, as they are among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or in conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of things humane. Everie church, which in deed is a church, is conſidered two waies, on Gods behalf (as they ſpeak) &amp; on our behalf.] On Gods behalf, it is altogether a church, wherſoever there is found a companie called of God, with his calling by the ſpirit &amp; the holy Scripture, &amp; the miniſterie of perſons ordeined for holy things &amp; divine actions. [On our behalf, there is no church at al, (although it be ſo of God,<note place="margin">And this alſo.</note> as we haue ſaid) to which there doth not cleaue corruption, concerning the perſons, things, actions, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the whole miniſtration of man ordeyned by God. Now that which is on Gods part, is not taken away by our default, ſo long as it ſeemeth good unto the Lord, to acknovvledge it for his church, and call it by his calling, by the ſpirit, and holy Scripture, and the miniſterie. For shall the unbeleef of men, (ſaith the Apoſtle Rom. 3, 3.) make the faith of God without effect? shal the weaknes of man make voide the truth of God? or his imperfection the perfection of God? Far be it off: yea let God be true and everie man a lyer, ſaith the Apoſtle in the ſame place.]</p>
                  <p>We wil make the matter plain by an example &amp; ſimilitude out of the words of Ieremie, ch. 3. A wife being filthie with adulteries, if her husband will pardon her, and conſent to receiue her,<note place="margin">And theſe clauſes he paſseth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> and to dwell with her, she abideth ſtill the wife of her husband, [not in deed by her own fact (for she hath broken wedlock, what in her was) but by the benefit or goodnes of her husband.] So a church overflowing not onely with lighter infirmities, but alſo with grievous adulteries, [should ceaſe in deed on her part to be a wife, but she ceaſeth not on her husbands part.] For touching the election, as the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 11, 28. she is beloved for the fathers ſakes, ſpeaking of the church of the Iewes. [It is a church ſo long whiles God calling her, proclaymeth that which is in Ier. 3, 13. Onely acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord thy God,<note place="margin">And theſe following.</note> &amp; haſt ſcattered thy waies to the ſtraungers under everie green tree, and ye haue not obeyed my voice, ſaith the Lord. Turn, O backſlyding people, ſaith the Lord, for I am maried unto you, &amp; I wil receiue you &amp;c. It is a church ſo long, whiles God with proteſtation calleth upon it departing from him &amp; being rebellious, as it is in Eſa 50, 1. Where is the bil of your mothers divorcement, wherewith I put her away? or who is there of my creditors to whom I ſould you? &amp;c. The church then at length ceaſeth to be a church, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ceaſeth to cal it back, &amp; taketh away the evidence of that holy marriage, that is, the holy Scripture, out of the hand of the adulteres, and her that is ſtubburne, teſtifying that the matrimonie is diſſolved on his part, &amp; ſo receiveth the covenant of grace to himſelf. It is not for any man, to deny that to be a church, which God calleth a church. Neither is it for any man, to cal that a church, which God, having giuen the bil of divorce, &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the draught of the mariage contract, denyeth ſo to be.]</p>
                  <p>And after this maner doe we eſteem of the church in which the papacie is. God calleth her with his calling, by his ſpirit, &amp; word, &amp; the publike records of that holy mariage (which we cal the holy Scripture) &amp; the miniſterie, &amp; holy things, &amp; actions,<note place="margin">And this alſo.</note> which before we haue briefly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned up. [Theſe things doe remain to that church moſt manifeſtly, on Gods behalf. But in that on the behalf of men al theſe holy things &amp; actions, together with the very perſons themſelues, abound &amp; overflow, with moſt grievous &amp; deadly corruptions, this is the ſinne of men, not the fault of God, whoſe grace &amp; truth is perfected in infirmitie On Gods part, she is yet called Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi, my people, &amp; Ruchama, finding mercy, which moſt truly on her part, may be called Lo ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi, not my people, &amp; Lo ruchama, not obteyning mercie, as we read in Hoſeah the Prophet. But we rely upon the mercy of God, and according to his grace revealed, we ſpeak our mind, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our ſentence concerning a church erring and going aſtray.]</p>
                  <p>[But this church hath every thing in it corrupt. I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes it. But] in that it hath al the divine things in the Scriptures, it is of God: in that it hath the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al corrupt, that is of it ſelf;<note place="margin">And this.</note> in that it hath al the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things, it is a church, in that it hath the ſame al corrupt, it is a corrupt church. The church is not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away by corruption, unles it be total (as they ſpeak) which they cal deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">And this</note> [A corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is in part doth not take away a church, but weke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it.

                  <p>[For to proſecute theſe heads particularly, which we haue briefly noted in the conſideration of the church God by the alone preſence of himſelf calling, doth lay the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church,<note place="margin">And this whole paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth.</note> in Chriſt the head therof. The church of Rome addeth another foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this foundation, &amp; to this head another new head (wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is called papal or popish) wherin it may likwiſe reſt with al. The calling is to God alone, in the church of Rome there is calling to others with God, &amp; the calling upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There the calling is by the ſpirit &amp; Scripture alone, whence it receiveth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, &amp; delivereth nothing more, then that which it hath received from the Lord: here it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth a miniſterie from the ſpirit of Chriſt, and of the Pope, from the Scripture, and the rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged traditions of men: there finally the perſons, things and actions are caried, according
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8260:97"/>
to the doctrine of the ſpirit, and the Scripture onely: here all things are taken and exerciſed out of the Popes changeable shop, and at his beck (as they ſay) they ſtand and fall. So all the marks on Gods behalf are in it: but for it ſelf, on it own part (as they ſay) there is no mark intire, no marke that is not corrupt by the papall poyſonfull ſorcerie, and the order of all things moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably perverted. For which cauſe in Lyons in France, a certain Frier did merrily preach to the people, when he ſayd the Hugonots (for ſo they are called in France) did conſent with the church of Rome in all their articles of ſaith, but there was one shrewd word, the word [Onely,] at the crack whereof war was in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>indled, for they beleeue onely what the rule of faith hath out of the holy Scriptures: but the church of Rome requireth more unto faith then is eyther conteyned in the rule of faith, or in the holy Scriptures, becauſe ſuch is the authoritie of the church.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">And this alſo.</note>[Theſe things being well underſtood, all men will eaſely perceiue how that Church, in reſpect of God or on Gods part, is yet a church: but of it ſelf is moſt corrupt, and verie neere to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But here doe ariſe two doubts and difficulties, by which the minds of many are troubled. The firſt doubt is, what we are to judge of the members of that church: The latter what the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of them is who are in that church, and ſee the great corruptions thereof.]</p>
                  <p>[To the firſt queſtion we anſwer on this manner, A threefold judgment had need meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this cauſe:<note place="margin">And this.</note> the firſt, of trueth: the ſecond, of charitie: the third of prudence or wiſdome. The judgment of trueth is of the common condition of the church, by which we judge from the calling of God, that as yet she is a church. The judgment of charitie is of the ſeverall members of the church, by vvhich we preſume they be members of the church, whiles they be called with the calling from God, and are in this way, as David calleth it Pſal. 2. The judgment of prudence or wiſdome, is that by vvhich we diſcerne and diſtinguish perſons, things &amp; actions, divine from humane, good ones from evill, true ones from falſe, and the degrees of theſe alſo amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For as of things and actions, ſo alſo of perſons ſome are corrupting through ignorance infirmitie, or malice wholly, or in part others are corrupted, euen in the ſimplicity of their hearts as the Scripture ſpeaketh: and of theſe there are a great number, of whom it were ungodly to eſteeme that they were not of the church of God. Of ſuch as doe corrupt we muſt take heed, Mat. 7. of the corrupted, who are corrupted yet ſtill, we muſt haue compaſſion. But the Church verely is not to be judged of the maner of either of theſe: for Chriſt ſaith not, ye shall not know the church; but, by their fruits, of doctrine and life, ye shall know them, Mat. 7, 20. And without doubt, they doe very unwiſely who judge of the trueth of a church, by the particular life or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of any men, who ever they be, eſpecially of private men: for the calling of God maketh the church, not the aſſenting anſwer of the men that are in it: as on the other ſide the Church ceaſeth not to be a church for the refuſall, or deniall of men, whereſoever the calling of God is. Now let us come to the ſecond demaund.]</p>
                  <p>What is the duetie of thoſe (wilt thou ſay that are in the popish church, and ſee the grievous corruptions of it?<note place="margin">And ſome clauſes here</note> Their dutie is ſuch as of thoſe children, which dwel together with their adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous mother: [for God hath uſed this ſimilitude in Eſay and Ieremie, as we haue ſeen before] A wiſe ſonne vvill euen from his heart abhorre the ſinne of his mother, he will with ſpeach and ſigne call back his mother from evill, and he will abſteine himſelf from it: and in all things he will cleaue to his father, [he will ſtand to his judgment, he will obey his will: and while he can by reaſon of his mother, he will cleaue unto her, next after his father: but when and whiles by reaſon of her he can not doe it with good conſcience, for the ſpiritual and bodily injurie of her,] he will betake himſelf into the chamber of his father,<note place="margin">Cloſet, or inner room.</note> [where alſo is the church the mother of us all. Gal. 4, 26. For this is not a good conſequent, if one depart from this or that church, therefore he doth altogether depart from the church. He doth but trifle that doth ſo from a particular, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude univerſally. A part of the flesh if it be divided or cut aſunder from another part by a wound received, is not ſtraight way to be thought to be ſeparate or cut of from the whole body: for it is cut aſunder, and the mouth of the vvound openeth, but neyther part is therefore diſjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the bodie. A godly ſonne therefore ought to cleaue to his father and mother jointly, ſo long as with good conſcience he can: but becauſe he cannot with ſound faith and conſcience haue fellowship vvith the unfruitfull works of darknes, Eph. 5, 11. he rather leaving his mother, cleaveth to God his father, and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, then that he vvill defile himſelf with thoſe foule deeds of his mother.]</p>

hand: and not content herewith, makes much a doe about a word (<hi>a rank</hi> of apoſtates) urging it contrarie to M. Iunius his meaning, hovv ever it be underſtood. For firſt, although the Tranſlator in this place uſed two vvords (an <hi>order</hi> or <hi>ranck</hi> of apoſtates) yet he might ſee M. Iunius his word was but one, ſignifying <hi>an order</hi> or <hi>an eſtate</hi> of apoſtates, as before he ſpake of <hi>an order</hi> or <hi>eſtate</hi> of apoſtaſie. Which vvord alſo the Tranſlator here kept and joyned with the other. But novv this word of <hi>an order</hi> or <hi>eſtate,</hi> ſo fitly opening the point in queſtion, and not leaving ſuch colour of exception or aequivocation, as M. Ainſ. ſeeketh after: he leaveth it, and taketh hold on the other. A ſleight and ſilly courſe. But (as himſelf ſaid erevvhile) <hi>what vvill not men doe, for help in time of need?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the word <hi>(ranck)</hi> it alſo is uſed in our tongue, for an order, eſtate, conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c. As in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 53, 13. where David ſpeaking of Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel, or the like, ſaith, <hi>But it was thou, a man according to my ranck,</hi> as the new Tranſlators haue it in the margent: for which they haue in the text, <hi>a man, mine equall;</hi> and M.

That the vvhole church or common vveale of Iſrael, Prieſts and people, vvere not of the ſame <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ranck, or eſtate,</hi> vvhereof David and Achitophel vvere. 2. That the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> or <hi>ranck</hi> there ſpoken of, was to be diſtinguished from the perſons themſelues othervviſe conſidered. Both vvhich M. Iunius obſerveth here, and M. Ainſvv. confoundeth or perverteth what he can. 3. That where the other Tranſlators uſe the word <hi>ranck,</hi> M. Ainſw. uſeth the vvord <hi>order:</hi> cleane contrarie to his dealing here, vvhere he leaveth the word <hi>order</hi> or <hi>eſtate</hi> uſed both by the author and Tranſlator, &amp; layeth hold on the word <hi>ranck.</hi> And vvhy ſo? That let M. Ainſ. tell us himſelf: unleſſe vve should think that he did it, becauſe the vvord <hi>ranck</hi> in our tongue, doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo ſignifie that vvhich is or grovveth thick together, as corne in a field, or the like; and ſo is applied to perſons or things in this behalf. So as thus <hi>a ranck of apoſtates</hi> may be underſtood of a <hi>companie of apoſtates,</hi> and thoſe alſo thick together: vvhereas M. Iunius, about this queſtion, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth difference purpoſely betvveen <hi>an order or ranck,</hi> and betvveene <hi>a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie or aſſemblie:</hi> making the one the general of <hi>apoſtaſie,</hi> and the other the general of <hi>a church:</hi> and ſo shevving that the <hi>apoſtaſie,</hi> and <hi>church of Rome,</hi> are tvvo different things, and diverſly to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>Which vvhiles M. Ainſvv. vvill not regard as he should, but conſound or abuſe, what he can: let others judge what vain a doe he maketh here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, and hovv yll in this behalf he dealeth vvith M.

                     </note> in the very next ſentence to one of them which M. Ainſvv. here citeth, M. Iunius himſelf shewed the fountaine and occaſion of this deceit, how ever M. Ain. (after his maner) paſſeth over it: namely, that the <hi>terme of the papacie taken doubly and aequivocally deceiveth men in ſuch ſort</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as ” here before we ſhewed touching the Romane popiſh church. For under the terme of the papacie (which is a vicious corrupt order) they comprehend the ſubject

it ſelf, vvhich is annoyed with that corruption, not diſtinguiſhing aright betweene theſe things, &amp;c.</hi> Which how true it is found in M.

Every page, yea almoſt every ſentence, is a vvitnes and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration thereof.</p>
                  <p>Or if in this place, by <hi>an order or ranck of apoſtates,</hi> we underſtand alſo <hi>a companie of apoſtates</hi> (as in the next clauſe follovving there is a vvord of <hi>number,</hi> that may be taken to imply ſo much:) yet any may perceiue that M.

And where he ſpeaketh of the <hi>many changes of the Romane ſtate, and great commotions, and troubles by the Gothes and Vandals, &amp;c.</hi> theſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concern the <hi>Romane ſtate</hi> (as himſelf here ſpeaketh) touching the city &amp; Empire of Rome, vvith the territories &amp; juriſdiction thereof: whereas our queſtion is onely of the church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>But be it applied to the church, which alſo went through all that great and generall calamitie: yet let us remember, how Ieruſalem &amp; Iudah of old vvere taken by Nebuchadnezar, the city and temple burnt, the land left deſolate, the people of higher and lovver eſtate, ſome ſlaine by the ſvvord, ſome perishing vvith famine and peſtilence, others caried away captiue into Babylon, and ſo remayning in captivitie, ſeuenty yeres: yet God in the midſt of his vvrath remembring mercy, ſtill preſerved a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: vvhom afterward he called out of Babylon (<hi>Ier.</hi> 51, 45 <hi>vvith Rev.</hi> 18, 4.) And in all the changes and calamities of that people, yet is their eſtate ſtil to be looked upon, as being the ſame people, though living in ſeverall ages, &amp; differing greatly one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, both in their religion, &amp; other condition, diverſly conſidered. Neyther is it to be neglected, that in all theſe chaunges and troubles ſtil they continued circumciſion among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and vvere ſtill continued under the covenant of God, though themſelues brake it many vvaies, and vvalked unvvorthy of it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89, 30— 34. <hi>Ezec.</hi> 16 <hi>chap.</hi> Which likewiſe is to be obſerved concerning the Church of Rome, and other churches of Chriſtians in apoſtaſie, in the midſt of all the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and calamities, vvhereunto they haue ben ſubject diverſly. Neyther can this man himſelf shevv, that ever the church of Rome ceaſed to be, ſynce it vvas firſt planted, but that it hath continued ſtill (eyther in ſynce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or apoſtaſie) euen to this day: Nor can he shevv, that the Lord hath yet put them out of his covenant, and giuen them a bil of divorce; or that they haue left off to baptize in his name, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And yet further (if vve mark it vvel) M. Ain. his anſvver about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is much like as the Papiſts giue themſelues.

                  <p>Many other things hereabout (if it vvere needfull) might alſo be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: on vvhich I purpoſe not to inſiſt. As, that by the invaſion and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities vvhich came upon Rome, &amp; the vveſterne Empire, by the <hi>Goths and Vandals &amp;c.</hi> may be underſtood the wounding of the Beaſts head, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off <hi>Rev.</hi> 13, 3. Now difference is to be put between the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> as is aforeſaid. Beſides, euen the Beaſts head thus wounded, vvas al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo healed againe. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13, 3. And an head, now vvounded, novv healed, is ſtill the ſame head, though in ſeveral eſtate and condition. Moreover, his ovvne narration here (hovv ever it be underſtood and applied, whether to the church, or Romane ſtate of the empire &amp;c:) is againſt himſelf. For if <hi>Alaricus with his Gothes</hi> did utterly vvaſt &amp; deſtroy it: vvhat remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for <hi>Genſcricus vvith his Vandals</hi> afterward to doe thereabout? Or if theſe did vvholly ſpoile and conſume it, what did <hi>Odoacer vvith another company</hi> there aftervvard? Or if theſe did effect an utter ruine, vvhat then did <hi>Theodoricus and the Oſtrogothes</hi> after that? And ſo may be obſerved of the reſt here ſpoken off, of <hi>Belliſarius vvith his army;</hi> of <hi>Totilas king of the Gothes;</hi> of <hi>the Saracens, &amp;c.</hi> If he ſay, he ſpeaketh not of an utter deſtruction, it is the more againſt himſelf. Or if he meane it of an utter deſtruction, his ovvne narration croſſeth it, beſides the teſtimonie of all hiſtories. Yea thoſe very clauſes, where he ſaith, that <hi>Rome for a time remayned vvithout any inhabitant, man or vvoman,</hi> (and that, <hi>by the space of fourty dayes,</hi> though he mention not this particular) shevv that this vvas not an utter ſpoyling of them for altogether, but onely for a time: and ſo is ſtill againſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore many of thoſe people, that made theſe invaſions, became Chriſtians themſelues, and ſo the church (in this behalf) vvas increaſed. Not to ſpeak how the very Catalogue of the <hi>Biſhops of the church of Rome,</hi> giveth evidence againſt him. Or vvill he ſay, that though there vvere Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of that Church, (vvhether better or vvorſe) yet there vvas not a church vvhereof they vvere Bishops? And mark, that in the particulars which here he ſpeaketh of, the firſt time that he noteth, is the <hi>yere of Chriſt</hi> 414. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Novv let him ſpeak therefore, vvhether till this time (and never after) there vvas at Rome, a church of God, under the covenant of God, having true baptiſme, or no.. If he ſay, there vvas not: to what end then is this particular narration of his, noting ſuch a yere, and ſuch a yere, &amp;c. Is it not all in vaine? If he ſay, there vvas: then it vvas ſome hundreds of yeres after Pauls time, that yet ſtill it remayned the church of God; yea and long after that many great corruptions, and the hierarchie of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt alſo, had ſeazed upon it. How alſo will he shevve that now at this time (let him take any of the yeres that he nameth) it ceaſed to be the church of God, and to haue Gods baptiſme and covenant any longer?</p>
                  <p>Finally (to bring the truth more clearely to light, and the matter to a plaine iſſue) let him conſider with himſelf, and ſpeak directly &amp; adviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>vvhether the church of Rome, that was eſpouſed to Chriſt, is become an harlot, or not?</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:8260:105"/>
If he ſay, it is: himſelf vvill ſoone perceiue all his diſpute here to be vaine and erroneous. If he ſay, it is not: how then ſaith he othervvhere, that <hi>ſhe is fallen into Apoſtaſie like Iſraels? Animadv. p.</hi> 84. For did not Iſrael, being eſpouſed to the Lord, become an harlot? And was it not the ſame Iſrael, for the body of the church, in the account of the Lord and his Prophets (though not in the ſame particular perſons, at al times) that vvas both the one and the other: whether we look on the ten tribes, or on Iudah, or both? <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1, 21. <hi>Ier.</hi> 3 <hi>ch.

Which is likewiſe to be obſerved, touching the church of Rome, and all other churches, in like eſtate, from time to time. Othervviſe the Papiſts one way, and the Anabaptiſts another way, wilbe confirmed in their errors, to the hardening of themſelues, &amp; ſeducing of others more and more. And ſo let M.

                  <p n="48">48. His eſteeming of the ſtate of the church of Rome in apoſtaſie, to be but as the eſtate of the <hi>Iſhmaelites, and Edomites,</hi> alſo as <hi>Adoniſedek vvith his Amorites and Jebuſites in Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> &amp;c. is diſproved &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradicted by himſelf, when he maketh them like <hi>Iſrael and Iudah,</hi> in their apoſtaſie. <hi>Animad. p.</hi> 84.

                  <p>Zanchius ſaith,] I agree not vvith them, that think the church of Rome hath ceaſed to be the church of Chriſt, aſwell as the eaſt churches, which afterward became Mahumetane. What church ever was more corrupt, then the church of the ten tribes? Yet by the Scriptures we haue learned, that it vvas the church of God. And how hath Paul cald the Church, wherein the ſaid Antichriſt should ſit, the Temple of God? Neyther is it Baptiſme that is adminiſtred out of the Church of Chriſt. Neyther doth a wife ceaſe to be a vvife, becauſe she is an adultereſſe: except she be manifeſtly divorced, being deprived of the ring, the pledge of the mariage covenant. The Church of Rome therefore is yet the church of Chriſt. But vvhat a church? So corrupt, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, and oppreſſed with ſuch tyrannie, as vve neither can with good conſcience pertake of their holy things, nor ſafely dwell among them. In Praefat. librorum de Natura Dei.</p>
                  <p>Polanus ſaith,] A particular church is either pure, or impure. A pure church, is a companie of ſuch as haue the true religion uncorrupted. &amp;c. It is very commonly called a true church, but by a Synecdoche. For everie pure church of God is alſo a true church: but everie true church is not alway pure: except that true and pure be taken for all one, as very often it is. Like as all pure gold is taken for true gold; but all true gold is not alway pure: for gold mixed with droſſe, is in deed true gold, but is not yet pure, till it be ſevered from the droſſe. A leprous man alſo is a true man, but not pure or cleane. So is the church of Rome as yet a Chriſtian church, but le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous and moſt impure. I will ſpeak it more plainly: A true Church is ſo called ambiguouſly: eyther as it is oppoſed to an impure church, or as it is oppoſed to a falſe church. If a church be ſaid to be a true one, as it is oppoſed to that which is impure, then it is al one as pure and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe. But if it be oppoſed to a falſe, and therefore no church, then it is not all one as pure. For at the time when Chriſt was borne and lived on the earth, the church of the Iewes vvas a true church of God, but it vvas not pure: becauſe it vvas corrupt both in the doctrine and diſcipline thereof. And except theſe things be diſtinguished, it will follow that there hath ben ſome time, when there was no true church of God in the world: vvhich is moſt abſurd. Polani Syntag. in fol. tomb. 2. libr. 7. cap. 8. pag. 544. And a litle after again, An impure Church, is a company wherein religion is corrupt. And it is eyther leſſe impure, or more impure, or moſt impure of all. &amp;c. The church of Rome at this day is yet the church of Chriſt (but moſt impure of all, but moſt corrupt of all, and almoſt giving up the ghoſt:) becauſe there is yet in it God calling, there are in it the called, and calling, which conſtitute a church; becauſe it reteyneth yet ſomewhat of the doctrine of Chriſt, though mixed with many errors, and becauſe it reteyneth Baptiſme the ſigne of Chriſtianitie, in the ſubſtantiall forme thereof, though defiled with many blemishes and corruptions: as alſo becauſe it reteyneth yet ſome invocation of Chriſt the mediatour: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they that are baptiſed in Poperie, should be baptiſed out of the church, and therefore not with the baptiſme of Chriſt. Briefly, the church of Rome at this day hath all things corrupted, but not altogether. As of old the church of Ieruſalem, ſo at this day the Church of Rome, is like unto a vineyard, which Chriſt fenced about with a wall, and gathered out the ſtones thereof, and planted it with the choiceſt vines, and built a tower in the midſt of it, and made a wine preſſe therein: but it brought not forth grapes, but wild grapes. Eſa. 5, 1. &amp;c. For the church of Rome is to be diſtinguished from the Popes Church or faction of Antichriſt, which prevaileth in the church of Rome, and will not ſuffer them that profes Chriſt more purely, but labours to oppreſſe them, that it alone may haue al. &amp;c. Seing therefore the church of Rome at this day is moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, and the popes church is that ſpirituall Babylon, it is altogether to be forſaken, as the ſpirit of God commandeth Revel. 18, 4. Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſinnes, and that ye receiue not of her plagues. Ibid. pag. 549, 550.

                  <p>M. Brightman treating of Antichriſt, ſpeaketh very often of his ſitting and dominering in the church. As when he ſaith,] The Dragon is the open enemie, throughout this book, who were the Emperors of Rome, as long as they remayned heathens. The Turks play this part in theſe laſt ages. The Beaſt is a more cloſe and craftie enemie, who is Antichriſt that ſitteth in the Temple of God, Brightm. on Rev. 16, 13. In the English, pag. 552. [Againe,] To be extolled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all that is called God, or that is worshipped, is not to be extolled aboue that one God in heauen, but aboue everie God in earth, that is, aboue all magiſtrates; not onely thoſe that be of the inferior ſort, but alſo aboue all that Majeſtie that is ſoveraigne amongſt men, the higheſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors themſelues, who are called Auguſti in Latin, as they be Sebaſtoi in Greek, of the high reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and worship that is done to them. Laſtly, as touching the true God, if Antichriſt should acknowledge no other God but himſelf, how should he ſit in the Temple of God, as the Apoſtle ſaith, he should ſit, 2 Theſ. 2, 4. M. Brightm. treatiſe of Antichriſt, againſt Bellar. on Rev. 17, ch. 1. pag. 628, 629. [And again,] He should not deny the Father openly, ſeing that by this meanes he should be openly known to be an Atheiſt: which is contrary to that which the Apoſtle teacheth, who ſaith, that he should ſit in the Temple of God. Ibid. p. 629, 630. [And again,] There is not one litle word left for you out of the Scriptures, which can teach that Antichriſt shalbe a certain or ſingular man, after the right manner of concluding: but we haue demonſtrated out of them moſt certainly, that he is that Apoſtaticall Sea of thoſe, that shal dominere in the church. Ibid. <hi>chap.</hi> 2, <hi>p.</hi> 642. And the like he hath often othervvhere.</p>

                  <p>And many moe I might alledge, of all ſorts of Writers and Witneſſes: but theſe may ſuffice. Yea it is ynough alone, that Gods Word doth ſo teach and confirme it, as before is manifeſted.</p>

                  <head>The Concluſion.</head>
                  <p>HItherto of theſe things concerning the Church of Rome. Wherea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout I haue vvritten the more largely, to help forvvard (what in me is) the better ſearching out, and more clearing of the truth, both againſt Poperie on the one hand, and Anabaptiſtrie on the other. For with the Papiſts, there is nothing more common, in pleading for the eſtate of that church, then thus to reaſon and aske, <hi>Seeing it is granted, that the church of Rome was the church of God in the Apoſtles times, when vvas it ſince that ſhe ceaſed ſo to be? In which of the Centuries after Chriſt? In what Popes dayes, &amp;c.</hi> Whereunto ſome anſwer, about 300 yeres after Chriſt, vvhen at the Nicene Councell the primacie of that Sea vvas ſo and ſo acknovvledged; ſome think ſooner, ſtraight after the Apoſtles dayes; ſome later, about four hundred yeeres after Chriſt, others about fiue, &amp; ſome about ſix hundred after Chriſt, &amp;c.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:8260:111"/>
Hereupon the Papiſts inſult, and both harden themſelues, and trouble o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers very much hereabout.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, the Anabaptiſts taking it for graunted, that the <hi>church of Rome is not the church of God,</hi> they caſt avvay the baptiſme there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and profeſſe to begin all anevv, and therefore are againe baptized anevv, and ſo proceed on in their courſe, as beſt liketh themſelues: being therein more hardened by others, vvho alſo ſay, that the <hi>Church of Rome is not the church of God, neither their baptiſme true baptiſme, but an Idoll, and lying ſigne, a curſed and deteſtable Sacrament, &amp;c.</hi> Thus errors and evils increaſe on all hands: whereas the way, both ſoundly to anſvver the Papiſts, and rightly to prevent the Anabaptiſts errors and evil courſes, is to anſvver, that the church of Rome, is yet ſtil the church of God, but in apoſtaſie; the temple of God, but wherein the Man of ſinne ſitteth, &amp;c. And therefore as it is the church &amp; Temple of God, to acknowledge it, to reteyn the baptiſme, and vvhatſoever ordinance or truth of God, they haue yet among them: but as it hath the man of ſinne ſet therein, as it is in apoſtaſie from the faith, vvorship, order and government, wherein at firſt it vvas ſet (as may ſufficiently appeare by comparing their preſent eſtate, with the Epiſtles vvritten by the Apoſtle to the Romanes, and the other Primitiue Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp;c) ſo to leaue and vvitneſſe againſt all the apoſtaſie, iniquitie, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and corruptions thereof: and to returne to the auncient and good vvay, vvherein the Church of Rome with the other Churches aforeſaid were firſt planted by the Apoſtles. Of vvhich point, I shall (God willing) by other occaſion ſpeak more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time (as I noted before) remember ſtil to diſtinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen the Temple of God, and the man of ſinne ſet therein, between the church it ſelf, and the apoſtaſie thereof: like as betvveene the Temple at Ieruſalem, and the idols of abomination that were ſet therein, betvveen the church of Iſraell, and the defection thereof. Which did not hinder, but that yet ſtill it vvas the Temple and church of God, though corrupted and defiled, ſo as none could lawfully in that eſtate eyther miniſter there, or bring their ſacrifices thither: but the godly choſe rather that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem should be filled vvith their innocent blood, then that they vvould ſinne and defile themſelues vvith the worship and abomination there uſed and urged upon them. 2 <hi>King</hi> 21, 1 — 16. <hi>and</hi> 24, 4.</p>
                  <p>Remember alſo ſtill to apply unto Antichriſt, what the Scripture hath otherwhere of the Beaſt, of the Gentiles, of Sodome, Egypt, Babylon, &amp;c. And refer what it hath of the temple of God, of the court of the temple, of the holy City, and the like, to the church of God, either more ſyncere, or more corrupt, in defection, or othervviſe. Conſider withall, if where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the termes of a true or falſe Church are commonly uſed, and many times not rightly underſtood or applied, it would not be good and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for diſcerning of the different eſtate of Churches aright, to uſe the termes of ſyncere,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſai.</hi> 1, 21.</note> or corrupt; pure, or impure; intire, or apoſtate; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or adulterate, &amp;c. And theſe alſo vvith degrees: as ſome more ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:8260:111"/>
and ſome leſſe; ſome more corrupt, and ſome leſſe, &amp;c. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vvell obſerved, vvould giue great light, for underſtanding and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things aright, both for judgement and practiſe: to eſchevv the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and evils into vvhich ſo many fall, ſome on the right hand, and ſome on the left.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the due obſervation of theſe things, vvil shew us both <hi>vvhy</hi> and <hi>how</hi> to leaue the preſent eſtate and apoſtaſie of the church of Rome, &amp; to returne to the auncient eſtate and integrity thereof: reteyning vvhatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they haue that is the Lords, according to his vvord; and renouncing vvhatſoever mixtures or corruptions they haue brought in of their own, vvhether concerning the faith, or the order of the church. This alſo (I truſt) may be a meanes, by the bleſſing of God, to ſtirre up both Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, and others that are any vvay ſo inclined, more carefully to conſider their vvaies and eſtate in their heart, and ſpeedily to turne their feet into the vvay and teſtimonies of the Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119, 59, 60. Which grace the Lord in mercy vouchſafe unto them. And thus much touching the church of Rome, and the matters aforeſaid perteyning thereunto.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Touching the Church of England.</head>
                  <p>NOvv whereas our oppoſites hold alſo, that the church of England is not the church of God, nor hath the covenant of God; and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme there received is not true baptiſme, but an idol, &amp; lying ſigne, &amp;c. their opinions are here again in many reſpects far more erroneous, and ungodly then before. For hovv ever ſome heretofore not regarding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right the faith there profeſſed, and lothing the corruptions there reteyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, haue miſconceived ſome things concerning them and their eſtate: Yet now that there hath ben longer time and more occaſion further to conſider thereof; ſeeing alſo into vvhat extremities divers of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen that are become Anabaptiſts haue by this meanes the more run themſelues; and ſpecially conſidering the doctrine of faith which they profeſſe in Chriſt alone unto ſalvation: it should teach al, more adviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heedfully to regard their eſtate in this behalf, &amp; to acknowledge them to be the people and churches of God, having the covenant &amp; ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme of the Lord, &amp;c. To inſiſt further upon particular reaſons herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, I need not: divers haue ben noted<note n="†" place="margin">Pag. <hi>30,</hi> &amp;c. &amp; <hi>58</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>121.</hi> &amp;c.</note> here before: where vve haue alſo shevved, that euen the church of Rome, is the church and Temple of God: as Iudah likevviſe and Iſraell of old vvere in the time of their apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſies. How much more then should we ſo eſteem of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (yea and of the Lutherans) vvho haue in ſo many things novv left the apoſtaſie of the church of Rome, and haue received the doctrine of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith in Chriſt alone, vvith many other precious doctrines of truth, that are yet ſtill miſerably depraved and corrupted among the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>But hereupon ſome object and ſay, <hi>If they be the church of God, none may
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:8260:112"/>
leaue them; it is ſchiſme for any to leaue thoſe that are the churches and people of God; and vvhy then doe you not continew Miniſters and members there ſtill? &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, to this objection I haue anſvvered before, <hi>pag.</hi> 116, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To vvhich I referre the Reader: as alſo to that which M. Iunius hath written concerning this matter: as may be ſeen here before, <hi>pag.</hi> 184, 186.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if this objection were ſound, then might none leaue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate of the church of Rome, ſeeing they are the church and Temple of God, as before hath ben declared. Yet the men that doe thus object, haue many of them left it themſelues. And M. Iunius shevveth, that both theſe may ſtand vvel together: to eſteem it to be the church of God, and yet to leaue &amp; forſake it in their eſtate: yea that it is our duty ſo to doe. But in deed (to note this by the vvay) wel may it be, that ſome Proteſtant writers, otherwiſe of great &amp; good judgment, haue heretofore the more denied it to be the Church of God, becauſe they thought if that were granted, it vvould then follow to be ſchiſme for any to leaue it, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelues are vvoont uſually to object. But the conſequence is not good: as is shewed before by the Scriptures and examples both in Iudah and Iſraell, &amp;c. <hi>Pag.</hi> 116.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in a Church there are tvvo things ſpecially that are ſtill to be reſpected, <hi>the faith</hi> and <hi>the order</hi> thereof. <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 5. For touching the <hi>worſhip of God</hi> therein, it may in divers reſpects be referred to the one, or to the other, or to both of them. Novv for the <hi>Faith,</hi> which is in Chriſt alone to ſalvation, we acknowledge that they profeſſe it ſoundly; and in the unity thereof vve alſo hope our ſelues to be ſaved with them: and therefore (albeit they intreat &amp; deale yll with us ſundry vvaies, yet) we hold them to be our brethren in the Lord, and in the faith of his Goſpell. But as for the churches <hi>order, worſhip, and government eccleſiaſticall:</hi> vve hold and profeſſe, that they ſtand yet ſtill greatly corrupted, and tranſgreſſing the ſecond commandement, many waies: As namely,<note n="‡" place="margin">Of theſe more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſee in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>logie, and other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of ours: alſo in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſe here following touching the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> in their Prelacie, and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our miniſterie; in their Canons, Conſtitutions, and Worship deviſed and impoſed by man; eſpecially in the Book of common prayer, according to which all the miniſters and people of that Church are enjoyned to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and partake of the holy things of God had among them: vvherein are corruptions not a few, that are alſo obſerved and written againſt<note n="†" place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters book of Lincolne Dioceſſe. The Survey of the book of Common praier, &amp;c</note> by divers of themſelues; beſides the refuſal, oppoſition, &amp; perſecution of the trueth, vvhich hath now a long time very often &amp; many vvaies benshew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, &amp;c. And yet more ſpecially, that the particular churches &amp; miniſters thereof ſtand not, as the primitue Churches and Paſtors did, immediately under Ieſus Chriſt the Archpaſtor (as touching their eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall conſtitution) but under another ſpirituall authoritie and Prelacie deviſed by man; neyther haue povver in themſelues (as now they ſtand) to receiue and practiſe all the ordinances of God, &amp; to redreſſe all errors and corruptions, that are manifeſted unto them by the vvord of God: as the Paſtors and Churches aforeſaid had. Which things ſtanding thus, hereby may appeare, that none can ſtand Miniſters or members of the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:8260:112"/>
Church aforeſaid in their eſtate, and performe the dueties thereof accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lavves and Conſtitution thereof: but they shall ſinne, and tranſgreſſe the ſecond Commandement. Which the Lord, that is a jelous God, accounteth to be hatred of him, and hath threatned ſeverely to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish: as on the contrarie he hath promiſed to shew mercy graciouſly to them that loue him and keep his commandements. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20, 4, 5, 6. <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Lev.</hi> 10, 1, 2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4, 1, 2. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10, 18 — 31. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19, 2, 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 19, 27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119, 126, 127, 128. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 29, 13. <hi>and</hi> 65, 2. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1, 6 — 14. <hi>Mar.</hi> 7, 4, 6, 7. <hi>&amp;c. Col.</hi> 2, 20— 23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14, 9 — 12. <hi>and</hi> 22, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly (which commeth to a like end vvith the former reaſon, but yet vvill make it more plaine) there are two things concerning the vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and ſervice of God, which we ought alwaies carefully to remember and obſerue. One, that we ought to leaue and forſake all the inventions of men, and more ſpecially al the mixtures and corruptions of Antichriſt the man of ſinne, in the ſervice and worship of God: And this not onely in things concerning the faith, but in ſuch alſo as concerne the order of the church. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20, 4, 5. <hi>with Deut.</hi> 12, 32. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8, 27. 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33, 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119, 101, 113, 128. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30, 21, 22. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 43, 8. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1, 6 — 14. <hi>Matt.</hi> 15, 9, 13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14, 9 — 12. <hi>and</hi> 22, 18, 19. The other is, that vve obſerue and practiſe all the commandements and ordinances of the Lord, vvhich he hath (once for all) giuen unto his church: vvhether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the faith, or the order of the church: and ſo conſequently the Churches government, vvorship, miniſterie, &amp; miniſtration of all &amp; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the holy things of God, according to his vvord. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20, 6. <hi>compared with Deut.</hi> 12, 32. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28, 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 15. <hi>Jude v.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6, 13, 14. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13, 8 — 12. <hi>and</hi> 19, 8 — 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119, 101, 128. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30, 21. <hi>and</hi> 33, 22. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14, 12. Which two things, ſeeing that in the preſent eſtate of the church of England nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miniſters nor members can obſerue them, nor be ſuffred peaceably ſo to vvalke: hovv can it be but we muſt needs leaue that eſtate, unleſſe vve should ſtill continew in ſinne, againſt the Law of God? And hovv can that juſtly be counted ſchiſme, vvhich is our bounden duty to the Lord, vvherein vve ought to obey God, rather then Man?</p>
                  <p>Fiftly (to make the matter yet more plaine) let us put the caſe, that ſome Kings and States vvould permit the Churches in their dominions peaceably to enjoy the miniſterie of the word, and the Baptiſme of elder people among them, but not of children: urging thoſe words according to the letter, <hi>Make diſciples, and baptiſe them, Matt.</hi> 28, 19. Or if of younger perſons alſo, yet vvould not ſuffer any to haue the Lords ſupper at all, becauſe of the many queſtions and troubles that haue ben and yet are among the Papiſts, Lutherans, and other Proteſtants thereabout: Novv hereupon I would aske, vvhether it should be ſinne and ſchiſme to leaue ſuch an eſtate, and to obſerue alſo Gods ordinance of the Lords ſupper, according to his inſtitution? Or if any vvould permit the uſe of it, but onely under one kind: Or if in both kinds, to wit, both with bread &amp; wine, yet vvould not admit it vvithout the acknowledgment of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:8260:113"/>
or at leaſt of Conſubſtantiation, preſſing ſtill thoſe vvords, <hi>This is my body, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 26, 26. Or would not haue it admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred according to the ſimplicity of the Goſpell, but as Princes or people did themſelues like beſt to haue it: Or admitting both preaching of the vvord and miniſtration of the Sacraments, yet would haue al, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo profane and notoriouſly vvicked, to be partakers of the Lords Table, and not to be cenſured, admonished, debarred, excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp;c. Or would not ſuffer the people to chuſe their ovvne Officers, according to the word of God: or the Officers not to performe the dueties vvhich God requireth at their hands, but at the pleaſure of man, Princes or people, or at leaſt of the greater part of the people, urging thoſe vvords, <hi>Tell the church, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 18, 17. and, <hi>All things are yours, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 21, 22, 23. Or finally and ſummarily, vvould not ſuffer the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the miniſters, and people, to obſerue whatſoever Chriſt hath commanded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28, 20. but if they had the word preached, would not ſuffer the ſeales of Gods mercy, the Sacraments, one or both to be enjoyed; or if they had both theſe, vvould not permit the Lords diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to be had, the cenſures and ſanctions of his judgment, according to his word and inſtiſtution, &amp;c. Whether novv (I ſay) in theſe and ſuch like caſes, we should not obey God rather then man: and whether it be ſchiſme and ſinne ſo to doe?</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, the church of England it ſelf, and all the reformed churches and Proteſtants at this day, are charged by the Papiſts to be ſchiſmaticks, for leaving the preſent eſtate of the church of Rome. But are they therefore ſo in deed? Sundry Proteſtant Writers haue shewed good reaſons to the contrarie: divers of vvhich (being indifferently vveighed) may be applied to the points &amp; caſe now treated off: (albeit withal I acknowledge great and unſpeakable difference to be between the eſtate of theſe churches: &amp; bleſſe God daily for the many good things had in the church of England, &amp; (for that they haue left the church of Rome.) For which ſee particularly of our ovvn countreymen) <hi>D. Raynolds ſixt Concluſion:</hi> eyther in Latin, or as it is in English joyned with his Conference vvith Hart, <hi>pag.</hi> 666, 667, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>D.

                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, vvhereas <hi>Conformity</hi> is much urged; and ſuch as doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelues, are charged vvith ſchiſme (vvhether they remayne in that church, or leaue the preſent eſtate thereof, that they may keep the ordinances of God according to his vvord:) vve are ſtill to remember, that there is a double Conformitie, touching the outward worship of God; The one is that Conformitie of rites and order, which the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth and preſcribeth in his word; The other is the conformity vvhich the lavves and conſtitutions of men ordeyn and require. To the former, all are bound: and unto it the Lord hath giuen his promiſe. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28, 18, 19, 20. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14. <hi>compared with Exod.</hi> 20, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12, 32. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1, 7 — 14. Where Piſcator well obſerveth, that <hi>in the outward worſhip of God there is required both a conformitie of rite agreeing with the preſcript of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:8260:113"/>
and ſynceritie in all which performe that worſhip to the Lord. Piſcat. Obſerv. in Mal.</hi> 1, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the latter, we are bound no further or othervviſe then as it agreeth with the conformitie preſcribed by the Lord himſelf, becauſe vve muſt worship the Lord onely as he hath appointed in his vvord, and as we haue the promiſe of his acceptance and bleſſing therewithall. For which, ſee the <hi>Scriptures aforeſaid, and Deut.</hi> 4, 1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119, 101, 128. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 29, 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30; 21, 22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15, 9. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4, 15, 17. <hi>Amos</hi> 5, 4, 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22, 18, 19. Some other things perteyning hereunto, ſee alſo before, pag. 116, 117, &amp;c. and in the third Treatiſe here following.</p>
                  <p>Now if any aske vvhether that Chriſtians and Churches may not and ought not to beare one with another, in their differences: of this alſo I haue ſpoken here before, pag. 118, and 119, &amp;c. the brief ſumme whereof is this, that we may and should ſo doe, vvhen the Churches and Paſtors thereof profeſſing the faith of Chriſt, ſtand (in their eccleſiaſticall eſtate) immediately under Ieſus Chriſt; having libertie &amp; power in themſelues, to receiue any truth, and redres any error or evil, as they shalbe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereof; and in the meane time doe not urge others to ſinne in their owne perſons, but ſuffer them peaceably to practiſe and walk in the vvay and order, which the Lord hath preſcribed in his word. Which if it vvere the eſtate &amp; dealing of the churches in England and other the like at this day, the queſtion would (in divers reſpects) be othervviſe, for eſteeming of them, and vvalking with them, then novv it is.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are the things which I thought here to note (by this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) touching the church of England, in regard of the points in queſtion betvveen us, &amp; the Anabaptiſts, &amp; others to much overcaried that way. Other things there are alſo good to be conſidered off: as namely, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers degrees of Gods manifeſting the truth, and conſuming of Antichriſt with his apoſtaſie; the different eſtate and proceeding of the Angels, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14, 6, 8, 9, 15, 17. <hi>&amp;c. and</hi> 15. <hi>and</hi> 16 <hi>chap. &amp;c.</hi> the difference of ordinarie and extraordinarie eſtate and calling; the divers conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirituall, and bodily or perſonall communion; the diſtinction of Provinciall, Dioceſan, and particular churches, vvith the Bishops thereof; Alſo whether the particular churches among them, be not become parts and members of the Dioceſan and Provinciall churches, in their eſtate; Whether the prelates bereaue not the particular churches of many rights perteyning unto them, &amp; more particularly take away from them ſome ſpeciall rights and dueties of the Paſtors, ruling Elders, people, and (in ſome reſpects) of al eſtates generally among them: Finally, whether ſuch Miniſters as haue left the corruptions of that eſtate, and liue in Churches rightly eſtablished, may not yet notvvithſtanding upon occaſion<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 13 <hi>chap.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether God hath not in Chriſt, before the foundation of the world, according to the good pleaſure of his wil, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordeyned ſome to eternall life; to be accomplished through Chriſt the Mediatour, to the praiſe of the glorie of his grace. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1, 3 — 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 13, 48. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25, 34. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 2 — 5, 19, 20. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13, 8. <hi>and</hi> 21, 27. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5, 9. <hi>Amos</hi> 9, 9, 11, 12. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>compared with Rom.</hi> 8, 28, 29, 30. <hi>and</hi> 9, 11, 12, 13, 23.</p>
               <p>Where (for the ſpeciall point now in controverſie) let us conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the originall fountaine and onely cauſe moving God in himſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, be not <hi>the good pleaſure of his will:</hi> &amp; not the vvill of man; neyther our faith, or vvorks foreſeen; nor any other thing from without God himſelf vvhatſoever.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Scripture thus teacheth, in theſe places and the like: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1, 5, 9, 11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33, 19. <hi>vvith Rom.</hi> 9, 11, 15, 16, 21, 23. <hi>Matt.</hi> 11, 26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20, 15. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1, 18. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12, 32. <hi>compared with</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12, 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11, 1, 2, 5, 6, 33, 34, 35, 36.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And otherwiſe, Gods election should rely and be grounded partly on man, and not onely on God himſelf, that he may be all in all. And ſo Gods decree of election fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> everlaſting should not be onely of his owne free grace, but partly of our ſelues; or by reaſon of our faith, works, or vvorthynes foreſeen: <hi>Contrarie to the Scriptures aforeſaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Then alſo part of the glorie of our ſalvation should be aſcribed to man, &amp; not the whole to God alone. Neyther should we haue ſuch cauſe of being humbled in our ſelues; and of renouncing all confidence in any vvorthynes of our ovvne; that ſo vve may in deed giue all glorie to God,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:8260:115"/>
as novv vve haue. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1, 3 — 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 11, 16, 23, 36. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 26 — 31. &amp; 4, 7. <hi>with Ier.</hi> 9, 23, 24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16, 14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Othervviſe alſo our election should not be altogether certaine and unchangeable, as novv it is, inaſmuch as it is grounded onely upon God, vvith vvhom is no chaunge or shadow of turning: and not upon man, vvho is ſubject to chaunge and alteration. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 11. <hi>and</hi> 11, 2, 5, 29. <hi>with Hoſ.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10, 16 — 29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 2 — 5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 12. <hi>and</hi> 2, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 29, 30, 33, 38, 39. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3, 6. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1, 17. <hi>Numb.</hi> 23, 19. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15, 29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102, 13, 14, 27, 28. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3, 14. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 46, 10. Which is the more to be obſerved, becauſe they themſelues alſo write, that the Saincts and faithfull may fall avvay wholy from the grace of God, and perish for ever. So as their owne opinions being layd together, they ſeem to deale in this matter, much like as the Anabaptiſts doe in the other aforeſaid: Who vvhen the Lord himſelf hath giuen us a ſure ground for the miniſtration of Baptiſme to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and their children, to wit, Gods gracious covenant and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: they (to exclude children from the participation thereof) vvould bring us to an uncertain ground, of Mans profeſſion of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6, 4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13, 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 8 13, 23. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, 10.</note> For although there may be good uſe made of ſuch profeſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other queſtions touching Baptiſme, and the miniſtration therof: yet vvhen we inquire of the right and ſure ground hereof, we muſt carefully keep unto that which God hath laid himſelf, for the adminiſtring of his ovvne ſigne and ſeale of his covenant of grace, and not admit of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain one relying upon man. And (to note it by the vvay) it is a good thing in religion (concerning the points and queſtions thereof) both for inſtruction and comfort unto us, ſtill to look unto the grounds thereof, and to obſerue vvhether they be ſure and certain, as relying on God, or doubtfull and uncertain, as proceeding from man.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Neither els should our faith and holines depend upon Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace; but his election should depend upon our faith and holynes. Which is contrary to the Scriptures: as may be ſeen, both touching faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 13, 38. <hi>and</hi> 22, 14. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2, 5. <hi>with Tit.</hi> 1, 1. and touching good works and holynes of life, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1, 4. <hi>and</hi> 2, 10. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 13, 14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 9. Where the Scripture shevveth,<note place="margin">See the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alſo, in another caſe, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods dealing with Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel; Hag. <hi>2, 23.</hi>
                  </note> that our faith &amp; holynes follovv after Gods election, as fruits thereof: and goe not before it, as cauſes thereof. Alſo, that they are meanes and vvaies by which God wil bring us to ſalvation in Chriſt; but not the fountain and cauſe of our election, to the Lord himſelf. By which may alſo appear, that the doctrine of predeſtination doth not any vvay hinder faith or good vvorks (as is objected:) but in deed ſtirreth up &amp; incourageth thereunto: inaſmuch as although unto God they are not the cauſe of our election, yet to our ſelues they are a good aſſurance thereof, ſeeing they are fruits proceeding thereof: and are alſo meanes vvhich it pleaſeth God to uſe, and the way vvherein he would haue us to vvalk, to ſalvation in Chriſt, and the glorie of his Name, for ever. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of therefore vve should be ſo much the more carefull, as we are deſirous to glorifie God, and to haue our calling and election to life eternall, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:8260:115"/>
unto our ſelues. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 1 — 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 28, 29, 30. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5, 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25, 34, 35, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Moreover hovv els is it true, that babes &amp; litle children are heires of the bleſſing of God, and perteyn to the kingdome of heauen: &amp; therefore alſo to Gods eternall election of grace? <hi>Mar.</hi> 10, 13 — 16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18, 15, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 14, 15. <hi>and</hi> 8, 33. <hi>and</hi> 9, 11. <hi>and</hi> 11, 1 — 7. <hi>Matt.</hi> 18, 2, 10. <hi>and</hi> 19, 13, 14, 15. <hi>with Heb.</hi> 1, 14. For upon the other opinions vvould follovv, eyther that God hath elected no infants to ſalvation, but that they are all rejected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate: or that infants (aſwell as elder people) haue that repentance, faith, and perſeverance in godlines: which is required by the Oppoſites to be in all that are choſen by God unto life eternall. Whereas many of them dye in their infancie, &amp; ſome the firſt moneth, or firſt day they are borne: and yet are partakers of Gods grace, and inheritors of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in Chriſt: as is aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Finally, there are alſo elect Angels, aſvvell as elect men: &amp; the like cauſe in God of his election of both: to vvit, the good pleaſure of his wil. Els should not the vvil of God be the ground and rule of al righteouſnes; nor God himſelf be al in all, Chriſt being the head of all principalitie and power, as the Scripture sheweth. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5, 21. <hi>compared with Epheſ.</hi> 1, 11. <hi>Col.</hi> 1, 16 — 19. <hi>and</hi> 2, 10. <hi>Iob.</hi> 38, 7. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3, 10. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33, 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115, 1, 3. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19, 10. <hi>with</hi> 1, 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1, 14. <hi>and</hi> 12, 22. <hi>Matt.</hi> 22, 30. <hi>Luk.</hi> 20, 35, 36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11, 36.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore the Scripture teacheth, that the election of God, is <hi>according to the good pleaſure of his own will:</hi> ſeeing alſo it is grounded on God and not on Man; being certain and unchangeable; of the free grace and gift of God; to the glorie and praiſe of his grace; cauſing and going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our faith and holines of life; making Infants partakers of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen; and having the like cauſe, as is of the choiſe of the elect Angels: let us therefore vvith the Scriptures, and according thereunto, acknowledge that the fountaine and originall cauſe of our election, is onely the will and good pleaſure of God, to the praiſe of his Name and glorie of his grace, for ever.</p>
               <p>Hereunto alſo agree ſome ſayings of the auncient Writers. As vvhen Auguſtine ſaith, <hi>Chriſt choſe us, not becauſe we beleeue, but that we might beleeue: leaſt we ſhould be ſaid, firſt to haue choſen him; and that ſhould be falſe which he ſaid, You haue not choſen me, but I haue choſen you.

Neyther els should there be in generall, one and the ſame cauſe of Gods decree, for election, &amp; for reprobation: and that alſo both of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and of men: as there is one Decreer of both, from all eternitie, to the glorie of his Name for ever. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 11, 12, 13, 18, 22, 23. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5, 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11, 25, 26. <hi>and</hi> 20, 15. <hi>and</hi> 25, 41. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 4, 12. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11, 33 — 36.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Els alſo vve doe not in very deed acknovvledge the vvill of God to be the ground and rule of all righteouſnes, in this, as in all other of his actions: how ever they ſeem ſtrange unto flesh and blood, which can not comprehend them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115, 3. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 14, 24 — 27. <hi>and</hi> 28, 29. <hi>and</hi> 46, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 1, 4, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 92, 5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25.26. <hi>and</hi> 20, 15.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Moreover, If ſinne foreſeen, be the cauſe of Reprobation, then it is eyther originall, or actuall ſinne. But not originall ſinne, becauſe then all men being ſo borne, should be reprobate. Neyther actuall ſinne: firſt, becauſe then no infants, no not of the Turks or Heathens, that dye in their infancie, should be reprobate: ſecondly, becauſe that then on the other hand, all of yeres should be reprobate and rejected, ſeeing all ſuch ſinne actually: as the Scripture teacheth, and al vvil acknovvledge. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8, 46. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14, 2, 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, 9 — 19. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7, 20.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Beſides, if unbelief or other ſinne foreſeene should be the cauſe of Reprobation, then should alſo faith and holines foreſeen be the cauſe of Gods election. But this is not ſo: as vvas shevved here before: p. 221, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Finally, vvhy els should the Apoſtle ſo sharply rebuke, ſuch as make vaine and odious objections hereabout, as he doth, vvhen he ſaith, O <hi>man, vvho art thou that replieſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the potter povver over the day, of the ſame

What if God vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhevv his vvrath, &amp; to make his povver knovven, indured vvith long ſuffring the veſsels of vvrath, fitted to deſtruction? and that he might make knovven the riches of his glorie on the veſſels of mercy, which he hath afore prepared unto glorie? Rom.</hi> 9, 20— 23. And hovv greatly again doth the ſame Apoſtle admire and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendly adore Gods dealing herein (teaching us by his example ſo to doe, as he doth) ſaying: O <hi>the depth of the riches both of the wiſedome and knowledge of God? how unſearchable are his judgements, and his waies paſt traceing out? For who hath knowen the mynd of the Lord, or who hath ben his counſellour? Or who hath firſt giuen to him, &amp; it ſhalbe recompenſed unto him again?

                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>Object. I.</hi> But this opinion and doctrine maketh God to be the firſt cauſe and author of all ſinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſvv.</hi> Not ſo: For firſt, the elect alſo ſinne, and not the Reprobate onely. And Gods decree of reprobation perteyneth onely to the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and not to the elect. Another cauſe therefore there is, and muſt needs be of ſinne, both in the elect and reprobate: namely, the abuſe of free vvill in Adam, in vvhom all haue ſinned, and of whom all are deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, both the elect and reprobate: and ſynce Adams fall, mans naturall corruption, &amp; his corrupt vvill &amp; concupiſcence. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3, 1 — 6. <hi>and</hi> 5, 3. <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vvith Rom.</hi> 5, 12 — 19. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1, 13 — 17. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7, 29. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, vve are to diſtinguish between the action, and the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, of ſinne: Alſo, betvveen ſinne, and the punishment of ſinne. Sinne (as ſinne) and the corruption thereof, is of man, who being made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, tranſgreſſed vvittingly &amp; willingly. <hi>(For vvhich ſee the Scriptures afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and the like.)</hi> But as it is an action, the abilitie to doe this or that is of God, in vvhom we liue, and moue, and haue our being. <hi>Act.</hi> 17, 21. alſo as it is the punishment of ſinne, it is juſtly inflicted by the Lord, vvho is juſt to punish ſinne. Thus God hardneth the heart of Pharaoh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4, 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9, 12, 16. <hi>vvith Rom.</hi> 9, 17, 18. and Pharaoh hardneth it himſelf, <hi>Exo.</hi> 8, 15, 32. <hi>and</hi> 9, 34. Which, as Pharaoh doth it, is ſinne: as God doth it, it is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of ſinne. And thus it hath the conſideration of good, for decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the juſtice of God. For God is juſt in all his waies, and holy in all his vvorks. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145, 17. and his underſtanding is infinite, vvhich man may admire, but ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 147, 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 77, 19. <hi>vvith Rom.</hi> 11, 13-36.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, diſtinguish alſo betvveen effects, and conſequents. Sinnes come after Gods decree of Reprobation, not as effects therof, but as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents that follovv after it. It is moſt holy, &amp; ſo not the cauſe of ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Neither is it ſound to ſay, becauſe God ſuffereth this or that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doeth it. Difference is to be put between Gods decree of permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, vvhich concerneth all; and between Gods decree of Reprobation, vvhich reſpecteth onely ſome, to wit, the Reprobate. Beſides, all know, that men ſuffer many things, which they doe not, nor can be ſaid to doe,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:8260:117"/>
nay vvhich many times they forbid. And the cauſe of an action (rightly and properly conſidered) is in the doer, not in the ſufferer.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Otherwiſe, let it be obſerved, whether theſe men themſelues doe not in deed by their opinions make God the author of ſinne, and of evill and deſtruction: vvho hold, that God would haue all and every particular man vvhoſoever to be ſaved; and cannot deny, but he is able to ſaue all vvhom he is vvilling to ſaue; and yet alſo grant (as the truth is) that he doth not ſaue all. What now vvil follow hereupon, according to their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, let them conſider with themſelues.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Finally, God is ſo farre from being author of ſinne (as it is ſinne) as he hateth, forbiddeth, and condemneth it: vvhich his word everie where, and his vvorks at all times make manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object. II.</hi> But the Lord ſaith by Ezekiell, <hi>I will not the death of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but that the wicked turne from his way and liue. Ezec.</hi> 18, 23, 32. <hi>and</hi> 33, 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſvv.</hi> 1. The Lord is not contrarie to himſelf, who ſaith by the ſame Prophet, <hi>As the vine tree among the trees of the foreſt, which I haue giuen to the fire for fewell: ſo vvill I giue the inhabitants of Jeruſalem: and I vvill ſet my face againſt them: they ſhall goe out from one fire, and another fire ſhall devoure them: and you ſhall knovve that I am the Lord, vvhen I ſet my face againſt them. Ezec.</hi> 15, 6, 7. Where the Prophet shevveth, that as the vine tree is by Gods framing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of it, giuen to be fevvell for the fyer: ſo alſo the Ievves &amp; inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Ieruſalem vvere then by the ſpeciall decree of God appointed to the fire and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Prophet ſpeaketh of temporarie death, as may appeare by <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33, 11, 25, 28. <hi>and</hi> 18, 2, 13, 27. <hi>compared vvith chapt.</hi> 12, <hi>and</hi> 13, <hi>and</hi> 14, <hi>and</hi> 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> vvhereas the queſtion is about reprobation to eternall death. And great difference there is, betvveen theſe tvvo: as may be ſeen in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Naboth and the Blaſphemer (ſpoken of, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.) who vvere both of them ſtoned to death. <hi>Lev.</hi> 24, 14 — 21. <hi>and</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21, 1 — 13. Alſo in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah and Achab, who vvere both ſlaine in battell. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22, 34, 35. <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35, 20— 24. Theſe now had a like bodily &amp; violent death: but shal vve therefore match them together as like, touching eternall death?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Difference alſo is to be put betvveene the revealed, and the hidden vvill of God, ſo to call it. As may be obſerved in the Lords dealing with Abraham, Ezechiah, and others. God biddeth Abraham take Iſaac his ſonne, &amp; ſacrifice him: yet Gods purpoſe vvas but thus to trie Abrahams faith and obedience: vvhich purpoſe of God was as yet concealed from Abraham, till God did afterward manifeſt it. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22, 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord alſo biddeth Eſaiah goe tell Hezekiah, that he should then dye: when God notwithſtanding doeth afterward adde fifteene yeres more to his life: which as yet was concealed from Hezekiah. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 38, 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet this double will (ſo to call it) is but in reſpect of us, and the manifeſtation thereof unto us. For otherwiſe in reſpect of God himſelf, he never would any other thing, but that vvhich alſo he doth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again, difference is to be put between <hi>willing</hi> as delighting with, &amp; <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:8260:117"/>
as decreing. Otherwiſe if God ſimply would not, none should dy at al.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Obſerue vvithal, vvhether in the places aforeſaid the Prophet ſpeak not of the vvicked converting to the Lord; and not of the Reprobate (whereabout the queſtion novv is:) For which, conſider that vvhich is vvritten in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18, 21, 22, 27, 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>I haue no pleaſure (ſaith the Lord) in the death of the wicked, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon obſerue againe, that God delighteth not in the death of a ſinner (in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) as it is the deſtruction of his creature, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18, 23. <hi>and</hi> 33, 11. But he delighteth in it (in another reſpect) as it is his juſt punishment of ſinne. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37, 13. <hi>vvith</hi> 2, 4, 5, 12. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1, 26. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 21, 17.

                     <hi>Object. III.</hi> But the doctrine of Gods predeſtination, eſpecially of Reprobation, should not be taught, or at leaſt not be taught unto the common people, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſvv.</hi> 1. Why then doeth the Scripture teach it: the Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Chriſt himſelf? The Prophets, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25, 23. <hi>vvith Rom.</hi> 9, 12. <hi>Exod.</hi> 9, 16. <hi>and</hi> 33, 19. <hi>vvith Rom.</hi> 9, 15, 17, 18. <hi>Ier.</hi> 6, 30. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>vvith Rom.</hi> 9, 13. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16, 4. vvhere it is expreſſely ſaid, that <hi>the Lord hath made all things for himſelf; yea, euen the vvicked for the day of evill.</hi> And Chriſt himſelf alſo teacheth the ſame, when he ſaith,<note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>or,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſse to thee</note> 
                     <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heauen and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things</hi> (the myſteries of the kingdome of heauen) <hi>from the vviſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes. Euen ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight. Mat.</hi> 11, 25, 26. Where it is evident, that Gods decree, not onely of election, but of reprobation alſo, dependeth meerely on Gods good will and pleaſure. Alſo, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13, 11. And again, when he ſaith in his prayer to the Father, <hi>Thoſe that thou haſt giuen me, I haue kept, and none of them is loſt, but the ſonne of perdition:</hi> meaning Iudas. <hi>John</hi> 17, 12. Like as Antichriſt alſo is called, <hi>the ſonne of perdition,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 3. that is, appointed to perdition and condemnation: As by <hi>the ſonnes of death,</hi> is underſtood alſo ſuch, as are appointed to dye. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79, 11. <hi>and</hi> 102. 20. And the Apoſtles teach it in like ſort: namely, the Apoſtle Paul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 11 — 23. <hi>and</hi> 11 <hi>chap.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 19, 20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1, 3 — 11. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5, 9. where the Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>Let us not ſleep, as doe others: but let us that are of the day, be ſober, putting on the breſtplate of faith and loue, and for an helmet, the hope of ſalvation:</hi> then preſently annexeth: <hi>For God hath not appointed us to vvrath: but to obteyne ſalvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And Peter likewiſe, who teacheth out of the Prophets, that Chriſt is <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence, to them vvhich ſtumble at the word, being diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, vvhereunto alſo they vvere appointed.</hi> 1 <hi>Per.</hi> 2, 8. And Iude the Apoſtle, ſaying, <hi>There are certain men crept in unavvares, vvho vvere of old foreordeyned to this condemnation, &amp;c. Jude ver.</hi> 4. Thus doe the Prophets, Apoſtles, &amp; Chriſt himſelf, plainly and purpoſely teach this doctrine. And should not then the miniſters of Chriſt tread in their ſteppes, being ſtill carefull to teach it wiſely, and ſoundly according to the Scriptures? For vvhatſoever things

are vvritten aforetime, they vvere vvritten for our learning, that we through pacience, and comfort of the Scriptures might haue hope. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15, 4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Moreover, this doctrine is both lawful, and good to be taught in the church: 1. Becauſe it glorifyeth God, aſcribing and yeelding to God, the glorie of his mercie, juſtice, wiſdome, and povver over all. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 22, 23. <hi>and</hi> 11, 33 — 36. II.

Becauſe it aſſureth us of the certaintie of our ſalvation, being grounded in the eternall and unchangeable counſell of God: It teacheth us to caſt off all confidence in our ſelues, and to aſcribe our ſalvation onely to the grace of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging and admiring the riches of Gods mercy, vvho of his free grace hath choſen us to life and ſalvation in Chriſt: It comforteth us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt diſtruſt, deſpaire, and other manifold tentations, ariſing by meanes of troubles and adverſities that befall us in this life, teaching us in all things paciently to reſt in the work of God: and particularly, it ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth us againſt the grief and offence, that otherwiſe we might take at the iniquitie and evill dealing of hypocrites and other wicked perſons, in the church, or out of the church: in aſmuch as we knovv, that God is the diſpoſer of all things, &amp; that they come to paſſe according to his eternall and moſt certain and determinate counſell, vvho therefore will vvork all things for good unto us in Chriſt. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 19, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 28 — 39. <hi>and</hi> 11, 33 — 36. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16, 10, 11. <hi>and Iob</hi> 1, 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11, 25, 26. <hi>and</hi> 20, 15. <hi>John</hi> 17, 12. <hi>Act,</hi> 2, 23. <hi>and</hi> 4, 27, 28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 3, <hi>and</hi> 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13, 8. <hi>and</hi> 17 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20, 15. <hi>and</hi> 21, 27.</p>

               <p>VVHether Chriſt haue not by his death, (according to the counfeſs and decree of God) redeemed onely the elect from their ſinnes, and from the vvrath of God due thereunto: and not all, and every one in the vvorld (none excepted) therefrom. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53 <hi>ch. compared with Rom.</hi> 8, 33, 34. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1, 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16, 2, 3, 4. <hi>&amp;c. vvith Act.</hi> 2, 25 — 36. <hi>Matt.</hi> 1, 21. <hi>and</hi> 26, 28. <hi>vvith Dan.</hi> 9, 24 — 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 7. <hi>vvith Exod.</hi> 12, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10, 15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1, 4 — 14. <hi>and</hi> 5.23.25. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2, 13, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 10, 17. <hi>and</hi> 9, 22, 24, 28. <hi>and</hi> 13, 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 18 — 21. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21, 27.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they that are redeemed from their ſinnes by the death of Chriſt, are alſo delivered from the wrath to come; and in Chriſt are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, quickned, and begotten again to a living hope by his reſurrection from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, being reſerved in heauen for us. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.34. <hi>and</hi> 4.25. <hi>vvith Eſa.</hi> 53 <hi>chap. and Epheſ.</hi> 2.5.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2.3.4. Which grace is peculiar onely to the elect, and not to all in the vvorld whoſoever. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Scriptures here noted before in the generall Poſition, and many other the like in the vvord of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prophets teach us, that the righteouſnes which novv Chriſt hath brought in, is <hi>an everlaſting righteouſnes:</hi> vvhereas that vvhich Adam had at the firſt, was quickly loſt and foone gone. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>vvith Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.12.20. And the Apoſtles teach us, that the Redemption which Chriſt hath obteyned for us by his death, is <hi>an eternall Redemption.</hi> Eternall (I ſay) not onely in reſpect of the typicall or temporall Redemption and reconciliation made by the Prieſts in Iſraell; but alſo in regard of the fruit and benefit, vvhereof the redeemed are in deed made partakers to eternall righteouſnes and ſalvation, by Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. <hi>vvith ver.</hi> 24,

Where yet further to this end may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how the Scripture ſpeaking of our <hi>Redemption,</hi> doth by this word ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meane the price and raunſome which Chriſt hath payed &amp; anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for us unto God; ſometimes our full enjoyning of the fruit &amp; effect thereof in eternall glorie. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1, 7.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 30. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 18, 19. <hi>vvith Luk.</hi> 21, 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. Like as the word <hi>Regeneration</hi> may ſometimes be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of our nevv birth that is begun in this life; ſometimes of our whole and full renevving to the enjoying of eternall glorie in the life to come, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3, 5. <hi>and Iohn</hi> 3, 3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 3, 4. <hi>vvith Mat.</hi> 19, 28. <hi>and Act.</hi> 3, 21. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3, 13. Wherein we may alſo obſerue, how they which are partakers of the one, shal likevviſe be partakers of the other. As vvhom the Lord once loveth, and accepteth in his beloved Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, them he loveth to the end. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 37, 38, 39. <hi>and</hi> 9, 11, 13. <hi>vvith Mal.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1, 5, 6. <hi>and</hi> 5, 2, 25 — 27. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31, 3. <hi>and Iohn</hi> 13, 1. <hi>and</hi> 15, 13. <hi>vvith</hi> 10, 15, 16, 17, 27, 28. So as then, if all and every one in the vvorld (without exception of any) be redeemed by the death of Chriſt, it vvould follow that all should be ſaved, having an eternall righteouſnes and redemption, and being made partakers of the loue of God, and regeneration, to eternall life. And ſo the Reprobate should be redeemed and ſaved, aſvvell as the elect, and the unrepentant, unbelevers, &amp; moſt vvicked in the world, should be partakers of eternall redemption, righteouſnes and ſalvation by Chriſt, aſvvell as the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and the beleevers, and moſt godly that ever vvere. Which is againſt the vvhole courſe of the Scriptures throughout.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſides that ſuch generall redemption cannot ſtand, vvith that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant and unreconciliable enmity, which God himſelf, upon the fall of man, did put between the ſeed of the ſerpent, &amp; the ſeed of the vvoman. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3, 15. By <hi>the ſeed of the ſerpent,</hi> I underſtand (with<note n="†" place="margin">Piſcat. in Gen. <hi>3, 15.</hi> &amp;c.</note> others) the wicked &amp; reprobate, who are <hi>of their father the divell:</hi> as Chriſt shevveth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8, 44. and by the <hi>ſeed of the vvoman,</hi> Chriſt himſelf ſpecially, and in Chriſt al the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; elect, that come of that our firſt mother <hi>Eva,</hi> there ſpoken off. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 11.14, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16, 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 54 — 57. Novv if ſynce the fall, Chriſt hath redemed all in the vvorld, whoſoever, euen the wicked and reprobate, then hath there ben a reconciliation made again betweene the parties aforeſaid; and that enmitie between them taken avvay: (for Chriſt is the Lambe, ſlaine from the foundation of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13, 8. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13, 8.) And ſo the counſell and vvork of God should be infringed, touching that hoſtile and perpetuall enmitie, vvhich the Lord himſelf ſaid, he vvould put between the ſeed of the ſerpent, and the ſeed of the vvoman, as is aforeſaid. But this cannot ſtand, with the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenes of Gods counſell, or truth of his word. And therefore is errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Not to ſpeak of that confirmation thereof, which the continual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all ages, and euen of this generation, wherein we liue at this
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:8260:119"/>
day, may afford.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And if vve look at Iſrael, we may obſerue, that in the Tabernacle &amp; Temple there were tvvo Altars: the one called <hi>the braſen Altar,</hi> for the burnt offering and ſacrifice; the other the <hi>golden Altar,</hi> for the burning of incenſe thereupon. At both vvhich, the Prieſts (as types of Ieſus Chriſt) miniſtred in Iſraell. The one more ſpecially typing out the <hi>Redemption</hi> vvrought by Chriſt, the other his <hi>Interceſſion. Exod.</hi> 27, 1 — 8. <hi>and</hi> 30, 1 — 8. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 40, 47. <hi>and</hi> 41, 22. <hi>and</hi> 43, 13 — 27. <hi>compared vvith Heb.</hi> 13, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Revel.</hi> 8, 3, 4. By which, as we may learne againſt the Papiſts, that Ieſus Chriſt is <hi>our Redeemer</hi> at the braſen altar (on vvhom alone vve are to relie for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;) and our <hi>Interceſſour</hi> at the golden altar (on vvhom alone alſo vve are to relye for the mediation of his Interceſſion for us, and not upon the Angels or Saints departed:) ſo likewiſe for the queſtion in hand, we may furthermore learne this withall, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt is Redeemer onely for them, for whom he is Interceſſour.</hi> And Interceſſour he is onely for the Elect and faithfull; and not for the world, the Reprobate and wicked therein. As Chriſt himſelf, and the Prophets and Apoſtles doe teach us. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17, 9, 20, 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16, 3, 4. <hi>with Act.</hi> 2, 25 — 36. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 33, 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9, 24. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8, 3, 4. Therefore alſo he is the Redeemer onely of the elect, and not of the world, the wicked and reprobate vvhoſoever. Which is yet further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed unto us, by the very names and titles, vvhich in the Scriptures are attributed to Chriſt agreably hereunto: as namely, that he is called <hi>Jeſus, Chriſt,</hi> the Saviour, the Annoynted one; the <hi>Author, Captaine, and finiſher of our faith and ſalvation; the great ſhepheard of the ſheep; the ſhepheard and Biſhop of our ſoules; the Father of eternitie; the Prince of peace; the Angell of the covenant; the Sun of righteouſnes; the comfort of Iſraell;</hi> and <hi>eternall life, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 1, 21, 22, 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16, 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 2, 36. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 10. <hi>and</hi> 12, 2. <hi>and</hi> 13, 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 25. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4, 14. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 7, 14. <hi>and</hi> 9, 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 5. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3, 1. <hi>and</hi> 4, 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2, 25. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5, 12.20.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hither alſo may be referred, that as the Paſſeover of old vvas inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and killed for Iſraell onely, and not for the Egyptians: ſo Chriſt our Paſſeover was ordeyned and ſacrificed onely for his Iſrael &amp; choſen people, and not for the vvicked and all in the world vvhoſoever, none excepted. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>chap.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. <hi>and</hi> 35. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 6, 19 — 22. <hi>compared with</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5,7. <hi>and Rom.</hi> 8, 33, 34. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 2, 18,— 21. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5, 19, 20.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſt by his death hath redemed thoſe onely, for vvhom the Lords pleaſure proſpereth in his hand: whom alſo he maketh to be his ſeed, &amp; him to be the chaſtiſement of their peace, to be healed vvith his ſtripes. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53, 5, 10. <hi>with</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 24, 25. Which fruit and effect is onely in the elect, and not in all whoſoever: as all will confeſſe. Otherwiſe alſo we should extend the redemption of Chriſt, further then God himſelf (vvho gaue him to death for us) intended it: and contrarie to the Scriptures, which apply it onely to ſome, and not to all and everie one in the world whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16, 2, 3, 4. <hi>&amp;c. with Act.</hi> 2, 25 — 36. <hi>Eſa</hi> 9, 6, 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 53, 4 — 67. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23, 5, 6. <hi>Dan,</hi> 9 24 — 27. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2, 33. <hi>Mic.</hi> 5, 2. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4, 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1, 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20, 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26, 28. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19, 9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 33, 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9, 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13, 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 1 <hi>Ioh,</hi> 5, 4, 12, 13, 19, 20.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="8">8.

And therefore onely for them that are the heires of ſalvation. For vvhich, ſee the Scriptures &amp; reaſons aforeſaid.

                  <hi>&amp;c. Dan.</hi> 9, 24 — 27. two things there are, about the vvord <hi>(Many)</hi> well obſerved by ſome vvriters: which here I vvill mention. One is, that if we doe thus tranſlate and underſtand the vvord <hi>Many,</hi> then we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the elect &amp; godly (for the number of them) are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered two vvaies: either in compariſon with others; or ſimply in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The elect and godly, in compariſon of the reprobate and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are few, and the leſſer number. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7, 13, 14. <hi>and</hi> 20, 16. <hi>and</hi> 22, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 27,<note place="margin">Piſcat. in Dan. <hi>9, 27.</hi>
                  </note> 28, 29. <hi>with Eſa.</hi> 1, 9. <hi>and</hi> 10, 22, 23. But being conſidered in themſelues, the elect and faithful are many, and the number of them very great <hi>Mat.</hi> 20, 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9, 28. <hi>with Eſa.</hi> 53, 11, 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7, 4 — 9. The other thing is, that the word here tranſlated <hi>(Many)</hi> may alſo be tranſlated <hi>the excellent, the great, the noble, glorious, honourable, &amp;c.</hi> as the ſame vvord is by Daniell (in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number) uſed &amp; applied to God, vvhen he calleth him <hi>the great God, Dan.</hi> 2, 45. and by others alſo is uſed, when they ſpeak of men, or other things, that are great or excellent: as in <hi>Iob.</hi> 32, 9. <hi>Ier.</hi> 41, 12. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8, 12. and ſo likevviſe may be underſtood, in <hi>Eſa,</hi> 53, 11. And thus it agreeth vvith Davids ſpeach (<hi>Pſa.</hi> 16.) where (uſing another word) he bringeth in Chriſt ſpeaking to God the Father, thus: <hi>My goodnes extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints vvhich are on earth, &amp; to the excellent; in vvhom is all my delight, Pſal.</hi> 16, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By vvhich Pſalme alſo we may learne (for the queſtion in hand) that the benefit of Chriſts redemption and mediation, is not to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Idolaters, unbelevers, or other like wicked perſons (verſ. 4.) but onely <hi>to thoſe in whom Chriſt delighteth,</hi> that is, <hi>to the Saints, that are great, excellent and noble,</hi> being made the ſonnes of God in Chriſt (<hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>vvith</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3, 1. <hi>&amp; Joh.</hi> 1, 12.) For whom Chriſt dyed, and roſe again from the dead, &amp; is ſet in glorie at the right hand of God, vvhere are pleaſures for evermore. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. And that thus we may underſtand and apply this Pſalme unto Chriſt, and to the work of his redemption and mediation, vve may learne by the Apoſtles themſelues, ſo alledging &amp; applying it, &amp; other pſalmes accordingly. <hi>Act.</hi> 2, 25 — 36. <hi>compared with Pſal.</hi> 16, 8 — 11. <hi>and</hi> 110, 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 132, 11.</p>

               <p n="10">10.

               <p>Herevvith alſo accord ſundry ſpeaches of auncient writers. As vvhen Ambroſe ſaith: God knovveth vvhat the Spirit deſireth,<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 26, 27.</note> and vvhat is the mynd of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints: as it is written, becauſe euen the Spirit maketh interceſſion for us.

               <p>And Auguſtine: The Donatiſts vvould not agree, that by the name of the World, the church could be ſignified: contrarie to the words of the Apoſtle, who ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf: and contrarie to the words of the Lord himſelf, who ſaid, The ſonne of man came not to judge the world,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3, 17. &amp; 12, 47.</note> but that the world through him might be ſaved. For the world cannot be reconciled to God and ſaved by him, unleſſe that by the name of the World, the church be underſtood, which onely being reconciled by him is ſaved. Auguſt. tom. 7. lib. contra Donatiſt.</p>
               <p>And again: He that ſpared not his owne ſonne,<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 32, 33. with ver. 29.30.</note> but delivered him up for us all: how shall he not with him alſo freely giue all things unto us?

Joh.</hi> 5, 25. Like as may be obſerved in that caſe, vvhereof the Prophet Ezechiell ſpeaketh: who when he vvas bidden by the Lord to ſay unto the dry bones, O <hi>ye dry bones, heare the vvord of the Lord; Thus ſaith the Lord God unto theſe bones, Behold, I vvill cauſe breath to enter into you, and ye ſhal liue; and I vvill lay ſinevves upon you, &amp;c.</hi> then ſaith he, <hi>So I prophecied as I was commanded: and</hi> as I prophecied, <hi>there was a noiſe, and behold a ſhaking, and the bones came together bone to his bone, &amp;c. Ezec.</hi> 37.4 — 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where again it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that the Prophets ſpeach or exhortation to the dead and drye bones, was the meanes vvhich the Lord vvould uſe in that caſe: and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was vaine or fruitles, neither yet implieth abilitie in the dead bones themſelues to performe the thing ſo required of them. The ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet noteth the like about himſelf, when he vvas falne on his face, at the ſight of the viſion, which the Lord shevved him, firſt noting hovv a voice ſaid unto him, <hi>Sonne of man, ſtand upon thy feet, and I vvill speak unto thee:</hi> and then preſently annexing, ſaith, <hi>and the ſpirit entred into me,</hi> when he ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, <hi>and ſet me upon my feet; and I heard him that ſpake unto me: &amp;c. Eze.</hi> 2.1.2. <hi>vvith chap.</hi> 1, 28. <hi>and</hi> 3, 23, 24. The like againe may be obſerved in the Lords dealing with Daniel: and ſo is noted by himſelf, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.8 — 19. And in Chriſts dealing with Lazarus, vvhen he raiſed him up from death, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.43.44. <hi>vvith ver.</hi> 40, 41, 42. And as touching the preaching and miniſterie of the word (vvhereabout the objection is much urged) we read in the Acts of the Apoſtles, hovv vvhen Luke had noted that <hi>Lydia being together vvith other vvomen aſsembled, heard the Apoſtle ſpeak unto them:</hi> he preſently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexeth, that <hi>the Lord opened her heart, that ſhe attended to the things spoken by Paul.</hi> And ſo she became a Chriſtian, and was baptiſed and her houshold. <hi>Act.</hi> 16, 14, 15. Which likewiſe shevveth, that inſtruction and exhortation is a meanes vvhich it pleaſeth God to uſe; and yet that the fruit thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon the Lords ovvne gracious and powerfull vvorking in us thereby, as he pleaſeth. Whereupon it was, that the vvord ſpoken by the Apoſtle, vvas more fruitfull in Lydia, then in the other perſons that were there alſo met together, to vvhom Paul ſpake, aſvvell as unto her. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.13.14. Without vvhich vvork and bleſſing of the Lord, no increaſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, whatſoever meanes be uſed: as vvas shewed here before.

Whereof novv being deprived by his ovvne voluntarie fall and tranſgreſſion, the blame therefore lyeth upon our ſelues, that vve are not able to performe the commandements &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations giuen unto us, unleſſe it pleaſe God to renevv us, and to vvork in us both to vvill, and to doe, of his good pleaſure. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1, 26. <hi>and</hi> 3.1 — 7. <hi>and</hi> 5.3. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.29. <hi>vvith Epheſ.</hi> 4.20— 24. <hi>Phil</hi> 2.13.</p>

As the Lavv shevveth us vvhat vve ought to doe, not vvhat vve are able to doe. Whereof vve may likewiſe make good uſe, to know our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſinfulnes the more; that ſo being humbled in our ſelues, we may pray unto God for his grace and mercie; &amp; that he would work in us his owne good vvork, with power, to the praiſe and glorie of his name, in Ieſus Chriſt.

Finally, the contrarie doctrine derogateth greatly from the glorie of God, and giveth unto man part of the glorie of our converſion and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For look how much we aſcribe to the will and power of man, ſo much in very deed vve take from the grace and work of God. And if it be in our ſelues, and in the power of our own vvill, to turne unto God, &amp; to exempt our ſelues from others that doe it not, then should we haue ſo far forth whereof to glorie. But moſt ſure it is, that we haue not where of to glorie vvith God herein, vvho vvill haue the full and vvhole glorie to himſelf, of our converſion and ſalvation in Chriſt.

                  <p>Whatſoever doctrines or opinions derogate from the glorie of God in Chriſt, and giue unto man part of the glorie of our ſalvation: thoſe are erroneous doctrines and opinions, and ſuch as cannot agree vvith the truth vvhich is according to godlines. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16, 13, 14. <hi>and</hi> 7, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 26, 27 — 31. <hi>Ier</hi> 9, 23, 24. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2, 8, 9. <hi>vvith Tit.</hi> 1, 1.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch are the doctrines and opinions of the Anabaptiſts, Arminians and others, touching the points aforeſaid: as in the particulars thereof may be ſeen. The Anabaptiſts derogate from the glorie of God, in that they doe not acknowledge the extent, and ſtabilitie, of his covenant; and the ſeale thereof, according to his vvord, and vvork. And in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and practiſe, they both adde unto, and take from the word of God. They adde in their repeating or renewing of Baptiſme, which God hath not appointed to be done: And they take away from it, both in that they deny the baptiſme received in apoſtate churches to be true baptiſme, and Gods ſigne and ſeale of his covenant; and in vvith-holding of baptiſme from children, to vvhom God hath ordeyned the ſigne and ſeale of his covenant to be giuen: as hath ben shevved here before, <hi>pag.</hi> 1 — 27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Arminians alſo in their opinions derogate from Gods glorie, and advance fraile man: namely, in the tvvo firſt of the points aforeſaid tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Gods decree: vvhiles they ground not the eternall decree of God, wholly and onely on the good pleaſure of his vvill: but upon the faith &amp; holines, unbelief or wickednes of men, foreſeen: In the third, by exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the redemption of Chriſt, further then the intendement of God; yea euen to the reprobate them ſelues: In the fourth, by aſcribing our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and ſalvation; in part, to our ſelues &amp; our owne free vvill: &amp; not vvholly and onely to the free gift of God, and povverfull vvork of his grace in us: In the firſt and laſt, by debaſing (in deed) the unchangeable decree and firme promiſes of God; the mightie power and faithfull cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie of Chriſt our Lord, the comfortable preſence, aſſured pledge, and gracious vvork, of the holy Ghoſt, in his Saints and faithfull people.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſuch doctrines and opinions of theirs are erroneous, and greatly diſagreeing from the truth vvhich is according to godlines.</p>
                  <p>Let him that readeth conſider. And the Lord giue us aright to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his vvord, humbly to obey his vvill, and faithfully to hold his truth, unto the end, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving now briefly treated of theſe points of Religion, which are called in queſtion betvveen the Remonſtrants, and others of the Reformed Churches: I will here alſo annexe ſome other things concerning the Reformed Churches themſelues. Which I acknowledge to be the Churches of Chriſt: and with whom I agree both in the faith of Chriſt, and in many things concerning the order and government of the church. Yet becauſe there are ſome particulars (of vvaight) touching the vvorship of God, and policie of the Church, wherein I think they are not as yet come to the ſynceritie of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Churches conſtitution; and am perſvvaded that the Lord is now bringing his churches and people thereunto (from the apoſtaſie and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Antichriſt the man of ſinne:) and that he vvill in time accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish this his work already begun, (vvhether before or together with the converſion of the Iewes to the Chriſtian faith, the Lord knovveth, and time vvill manifeſt:) therefore haue I thought it good herevvithal to note ſome few things thereabout.</p>
            <p>The particulars are not all of them of like waight or evidence (in mine ovvne perſwaſion) but ſome of them ſuch, as far more may be ſaid and borne vvith about them, then about others of them. Neyther doe all of them concerne al the Reformed churches alike: but ſome of them more, and ſome leſſe: inaſmuch as their eſtate in divers Churches and places doth diverſly differ hereabout. Yet notvvithſtanding I thought it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe thus to propound the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here together: deſiring of al, that they would ſeriouſly conſider theſe things, in the fear of God, and according to his word; &amp; hoping that the due conſideration thereof wil (through the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God) become profitable for the furtherance of the truth, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther building up of the church, to the praiſe of his name, in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>VVHether it be the Lords ordinance, that his churches &amp; ſervants, should (vvhen they pray) read their prayers out of a book, euen certaine ſet vvords impoſed by men; and ſo uſe a forme and manner of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:8260:127"/>
prayer and leitourgie deviſed and preſcribed by man, for their ſpirituall ſacrifice of prayer and vvorship of God: And conſequently, vvhether it be lavvfull for us, in ſuch maner to vvorship the Lord. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20, 4, 5, 6. <hi>and</hi> 30, 9. <hi>compared with Pſal.</hi> 141, 2. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 29, 13. <hi>vvith Mat.</hi> 15, 9. <hi>Lev.</hi> 10, 1, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.8, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 26. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4, 8 — 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. Seeing that the book-prayer aforeſaid, being not appointed by the Lord, or approved in his word, is an invention of Man in the vvorship of God. And mens inventions in Gods vvorship, are tranſgreſſions of the ſecond commandement. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20, 4, 5. <hi>vvith Lev.</hi> 10, 1. <hi>Judg.</hi> 8, 27. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119, 113, 128. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 29, 13. <hi>and</hi> 30, 21, 22,</p>
               <p n="2">II. Thus alſo it is as an image &amp; ſimilitude of ſpiritual prayer, which yet it is not. And ſo theſe books and ſtinted prayers preſcribed by man, in the vvorship of God, come in deed to be idols, ſupplying the place of the vvord and ſpirit of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vvhich ought not to be. In vvhich reſpect, ſuch manner of worship becommeth idolatrous &amp; ſuperſtitious, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Lord, and not to be communicated vvithall.

               </p>
               <p n="3">III. The incenſe offred by the Prieſts upon the golden Altar in the time of the Lavv, vvas a type of prayer offred up unto God by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Chriſt: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141, 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8, 3, 4. And therefore as it vvas not lavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to uſe any ſtraunge incenſe, but that onely vvhich God appointed: ſo neither is it lavvful to uſe any ſtraunge manner of prayer, but ſuch onely as the Lord requireth. <hi>Exod.</hi> 30, 9. <hi>vvith Pſal.</hi> 141, 2. Now that the Lord did ever ordeyne in his vvorship the book-prayer aforeſaid, vvho can shevv? Yea, or that any of the godly (either the Patriarks, Prophets, Apoſtles, or other men or vvomen) recorded in the Scriptures, when they vvould pray unto God, did ever take a book in their hands, to read out of it ſome ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted prayers preſcribed by men, for their ſacrifice of prayer and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God? Or can vve think, if this vvere the manner of prayer and worship vvhich God required, that the Scripture would be ſilent in it; or that none of the ſervants of God ſet before us for examples in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, should ever uſe it; or that vve should preſcribe or uſe ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of prayer in the worship of God, as never any of the godly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in the Scripture did uſe? If then in the time of the Legall shadovves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Moſes, God vvould not admit of any ſtraunge thing in his worship, but did ſeverely punish it, as may be ſeen in the example of Nadab and Abihu, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10, 1. hovv shall vve thinke that he vvill novv admit of any ſtraunge manner of prayer for his worship in the time of the Goſpel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt; whenas Chriſt the ſonne is vvorthy of more honour, then Moſes the ſervant. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3, 3, 5, 6.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. It derogateth from the honour, fruit, and benefit of the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt: vvho aſcending up on high, hath giuen gifts unto men for the worke of the miniſterie: and therefore as vvell for prayer, as for
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:8260:127"/>
doctrine and preaching &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 8, 12. <hi>vvith Act.</hi> 6, 4. If any be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued vvith ſuch gifts, there is no vvarrant to chuſe them to be miniſters of Chriſt. If they be ſo indued, there is no vvarrant for others to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, nor for themſelues to read over ſuch ſtinted prayers, preſcribed by men for the worship of God. Neither doeth it onely derogate from the honour and benefit of Chriſts aſcenſion into heauen: but alſo from the care, loue, and bountie that he hath and shevveth continually to his church upon earth, giving ſtill gifts unto men for the vvork of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, from time to time. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4, 8 — 13. <hi>and Pſal.</hi> 68, 19. <hi>vvith</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 4, 5, 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 1. <hi>and</hi> 6, 13, 14. <hi>with Matth.</hi> 28, 20. Els alſo why doe they not put a book of Homilies, in the hands of all the Miniſters, to be read over dayly for their ſermons to the people, aſvvell as a book of prayers, in and for the worship of God? And vvhy doe not the miniſters uſe the one, aſwel as the other, in their publick miniſtration?</p>
               <p n="5">V. The ſpirit of God is the onely help which he giueth us to help our infirmities in the time of prayer: (not books, or beads, or any ſuch thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 26, 27. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4, 6. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12, 10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6, 18. <hi>Iude ver.</hi> 20.

Beſides that Book-prayer quencheth the ſpirit, and abridgeth the work of the holy Ghoſt, ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the gifts and graces of God in us, and removing the heart far from God, hovvever we may ſeeme with the mouth to come neare unto him: inaſmuch as our prayers are not dravven and powred out of the heart by the help of the ſpirit of God, according to our preſent and continuall occaſions: but are preſcribed unto us, and read in a book, ſtill alike, from time to time, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 29, 13. <hi>compared with</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1, 15. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12, 10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4, 6.</p>

Therefore alſo should we not read our prayers out of a book, when we worship God: ſeeing it is not a living or ſpiritual ſacrifice, but dead &amp; carnal: And hovv then is it a vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship acceptable to God by Ieſus Chriſt? as all our prayers and worship of God should be. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>with Rev.</hi> 8, 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 26, 27. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5, 17, 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 1 — 5. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Iude v.</hi> 20, 21.</p>

to the vvord of God.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. To the ſame end may more ſpecially be obſerved the eſtate of the church of Epheſus, in the Apoſtles times: The Overſeers and Elders of which church are, in fower ſeveral places ſpoken of in ſpecial manner: <hi>viz. Act.</hi> 20, 17, 28. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4, 11, 12. <hi>vvith</hi> 1, 1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5, 17. <hi>vvith</hi> 1, 3. <hi>and</hi> 3, 1, 15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2, 1. <hi>vvith</hi> 1, 11, 16, 20. In the firſt of which places, <hi>viz. Act.</hi> 20, 17, 28. the Elders are generally ſpoken off, without the noting of any particular diſtinction among them. Onely their works and dueties are compriſed in the generall termes of <hi>taking heed to themſelues &amp; the whole flock;</hi> of being <hi>Overſeers;</hi> and of <hi>feeding the church of God.</hi> Which generall termes compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in them, al the dueties of al the Elders, though otherwiſe &amp; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where diſtinct one from another. In the ſecond place, <hi>viz. Epheſ.</hi> 4, 11, 12, there is ſpeach onely of the miniſters of the vvord, and among them, of the <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> which are for the <hi>vvork of the miniſterie</hi> more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly. In the third place, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5, 17. there is mention moreover of tvvo ſorts of Elders, <hi>the Ruling Elders,</hi> and the <hi>Teaching Elders;</hi> and thoſe alſo diſtinct the one from the other.

Thus much briefly I thought to note in particular touching the eſtate of the Church of Epheſus, and the Bishops or Overſeers thereof: vvhich being four ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times ſpoken of in the Scripture, and that alſo vvith ſuch different manner of ſpeach, as is aforeſaid: may help to giue good light and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto us about the queſtion in hand.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Finally, if the foreſaid order be kept, vve may by the vvord of God ſufficiently anſvver all the objections, and meet with all the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of the Prelates, or any other, that erre in this behalf from the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie &amp; firſt conſtitution of the primitiue churches.

               <p>And hitherto concerning the firſt braunch of this queſtion. Novv for the other point of the queſtion, there is alledged about it both Scripture,<note place="margin">M.

Which are alledged, to shew that the Primitiue Churches had many Elders in one church (which is graunted) and thoſe alſo all alike; &amp; therefore that they had not one ſpeciall Paſtor, nor (as ſome think) ſuch diſtinction of teaching and ruling Elders, as is aforeſaid. The record of the auncient Writers produced alſo thereabout, is to shew that ſometimes there were tvvo Bishops at once, in one church. Of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now firſt for the Scriptures (leaving the point, for the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſo to be eſteemed, as it shalbe found to be grounded on the Scriptures duly conſidered) there is alledged, <hi>Act.</hi> 20, 17, 28. vvhereby is gathered: Firſt, that there vvere many Elders in the Church of Epheſus (there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off) and not one Paſtor alone. Which I think none of ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vvill deny. Secondly, that the Elders were all alike, and of one ſort, &amp;c. Which if it were ſo, then 1. how is it, that the Apoſtle vvriteth to Timothee (vvhom he left with the Church of Epheſus) both of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and of ruling Elders, and the one differing from the other? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5, 17. <hi>compared with</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What then alſo or vvhere is the difference betweeene the Paſtors, and Teachers, ſpoken off to the ſame church of Epheſus? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And who is the Angel of this church of Epheſus, ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Or vvhere are the ruling Elders called the Angels of the Lord, or of the church, as the Prophets, Prieſts, and miniſters of the Goſpell are, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>with Rev.</hi> 1.20. <hi>and</hi> 2.1.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Yet neither doth this hinder, but that they had alſo diſtinction of office among them, for tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and ruling Elders: as there the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſuch, <hi>who spake the word of God unto them,</hi> and were their <hi>guydes and governours, vvatching for their ſoules, as they that ſhould giue account, &amp;c.</hi> where moreover the Apoſtle uſeth a vvord (HEGOUMENOI,) ſignifying <hi>Guydes, Leaders, Captaines, Rulers, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, chief, &amp;c.</hi> vvhich is attributed to the Overſeers &amp; Governours both in church and common wealth, yea euen unto kings, and to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: <hi>Gen.</hi> 49, 10. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25, 30. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5, 2, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14, 27. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20, 5. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26, 24. <hi>and</hi> 27, 4, 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68, 27. <hi>Dan</hi> 3, 2. <hi>Mat,</hi> 2, 6. <hi>Luc.</hi> 22, 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 7, 10. who is here alſo (in this chapter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13, 20.) called the <hi>great Shepheard</hi> (or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor) of the sheep: under vvhom the other Paſtors and Guydes aforeſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> miniſtred, and guyded the flocks committed unto them. And in Iſraell of old, they had among the Iewes, both Elders of the Prieſts, and Elders of the people: beſides other differences of the miniſters and Governors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: as vvas noted there before. And in the church at Ieruſalem
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:8260:140"/>
(ſince Chriſt) there was Iames, together with the Elders, overſeeing the affaires of that church. <hi>Act.</hi> 21, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Euſebius vvith other auncient Writers, notes the names of ſundry Bishops (or Paſtors) who after Iames follovved, one another, in that church, for a long time aftervvard: as is aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Concerning the place, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5, 1 — 4. the ſame things may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as about the other Scriptures before mentioned.

Which again plainely implyeth other Paſtors &amp; Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, that are inferiour and ſubordinate unto him, vvho is the chief and great shepheard of the sheep, and Bishop of our ſoules. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13, 20. <hi>and</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 25. <hi>and</hi> 5, 1 — 4. <hi>with Ioh.</hi> 21.15, 16.17. <hi>Act.</hi> 20, 17, 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7.8. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.11, 12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5, 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2, 1, 8. <hi>&amp;,.</hi> And hitherto of theſe things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe allegations out of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Another allegation, about the matter aforeſaid, is taken out of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers,<note place="margin">Park. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. eccleſ. p. <hi>236.</hi> &amp;c.</note> shewing that in ſome churches heretofore there were two Bishops (or Paſtors) in one and the ſame office, in one church at once. As namely, that there vvas in the church of Ieruſalem, at once, <hi>Narciſſus</hi> and <hi>Alexander:</hi> and in the church of Hippo, <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> in Rome, <hi>Felix</hi> &amp; <hi>Liberius;</hi> in Nazianzum, <hi>Gregorie</hi> the father, &amp; <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſonne, &amp;c. <hi>Euſeb. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 7.9.10. <hi>Sozomen. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 14. <hi>Auguſt. epiſt.</hi> 110. <hi>Gregor. Nazianz. epiſt. ad Gregor. Nyſſenum.</hi> Whereabout may be conſidered, I. Whether this vvas ordinarie, or extraordinarie. If ordinarie, how is it then that the ſame &amp; other auncient vvriters, doe uſually ſtill make mention but of one, in one church, at one time, as in their vvritings everie vvhere may be ſeen? If extraordinarie and upon ſome ſpeciall occaſions, what then vvas the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie courſe that vvas otherwiſe kept and obſerved uſually?</p>
               <p n="2">II. By the inſtances alledged, it appeareth that there were but two of theſe Bishops, in theſe churches, at thoſe times: Whereas by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures alledged, and the generall acknovvledgement almoſt of all, there may be many Elders or Bishops in a church, and far moe then tvvo. Yea if there were but one paſtor, one teacher, &amp; one ruling Elder, in a church, there vvould yet be moe Elders or Bishops then two at once.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The tvvo aforeſaid alſo vvere both of them teaching Elders, and Miniſters of the vvord and Sacraments: vvhereas the Scriptures shevve, that there vvere and should be in the Church, both teaching and ruling Elders.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. The vvriters vvhich mention theſe, note ſome ſpecial occaſions thereof, as that it was in caſe of old age, or ſicknes, or ſpecial good liking and approbation of the parties, and returning to the churches and places from which through troubles or otherwiſe they had ſome vvhile ben ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or other the like: and ſome difference vvithall obſerved betvveene
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:8260:141"/>
ſome of them. Which is alſo duly to be regarded. For vvhich, ſee <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and places aforeſaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. The time moreover is to be noted, when this vvas done. Which by the inſtances alledged, appeareth to be ſome good vvhile after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles dayes: Whereas the queſtion is, concerning the primitiue inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and practiſe from the beginning.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Alſo, if ſuch examples in later times, ſo recorded by theſe writers, should be reſpected, vvhy should not then the other examples of former times, recorded by the ſame and other Writers likewiſe?</p>
               <p n="7">VII. And finally, the onely ſure ground of truth, and end of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in Religion, is the word of God: vvherevvith ſo far as the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Writers accord, their teſtimonies &amp; vvritings may in their place well be regarded. According to it therefore I leaue theſe things, vvith the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before alledged out of the Scriptures, to be conſidered &amp; diſcuſſed. And hitherto of the latter braunch of this queſtion.</p>
               <p>Novv furthermore, note withall, that how ever it be for the matter in hand, touching the Paſtors and other Elders of particular churches: yet ſtill it lyeth on them, who receiue or plead for Dioceſan and Provinciall churches, Paſtors, or Bishops, that they shevv ſuch churches and Paſtors planted by the Apoſtles at the beginning. For if it cannot be shevved, that the Apoſtles (by vertue of their commiſſion from Chriſt) eſtablished ſuch Dioceſan and Provincial churches and Bishops, who then may eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish or ſubmit unto them? If they vvho were the Maſter-builders under Chriſt, did not ſet them up, vvhat povver then is there under heauen that may erect them? and what homage is it, that a Chriſtian ſoule can with good conſcience yeeld unto them, in this behalf?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The churches muſt be ſuch, and ſo eſtablished, as the Lord appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and approveth in his vvord. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1, 12, 20. And everie officer in the church muſt (in a due regard) be counted a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber in the body of Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 3 — 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 12 — 28. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4, 4 — 16. And none may ſet members in the body of Chriſt, but the Lord himſelf. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 18, 28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Euen as on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie none may keep out, deſpiſe, or abandon thoſe vvhom the Lord hath appointed to be in his church, and to continevv therein, to the end of the vvorld. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6.7.8. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4, 11, 12. <hi>with Eſa.</hi> 66, 21. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1 — 15. <hi>and</hi> 5, 3, 9, 17. <hi>with</hi> 6, 13, 14. <hi>and with Mat.</hi> 28.18.19.20. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. <hi>and</hi> 12, 42, 43. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13, 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5, 1 — 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1, 16, 20. <hi>and</hi> 2, 1, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreover the functions &amp; duties of ſuch Prelates (if they be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body of Chriſt) are to be shewed out of the word of God: as vve ſee done for the Officers of particular churches. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11.12. <hi>vvith Eſa.</hi> 66.21. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12.13.24. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as vvas in Iſraell, for the hy Prieſt, and for the other Prieſts and Levites: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that vvhich was in their cities and Synagogues. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. <hi>and</hi> 29. <hi>Lev.</hi> 1 — 16 <hi>chap. &amp;c. Num.</hi> 3, <hi>and</hi> 4, <hi>and</hi> 8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16 — 19 <hi>chap. Joſh.</hi> 21 <hi>chap.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23 — 26 <hi>ch. Luke</hi> 4, 16 — 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.14.15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The place alſo and manner, vvhere and hovv ſuch Bishops doe and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:8260:141"/>
can meet together with the reſt of the body whereof they are members, that is, with their Dioceſan and Provinciall churches, is to be shewed in their practiſe, &amp; agreable to the Scriptures: as may be done for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of particular churches, and their aſſemblies, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1, 20. <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>and</hi> 3 <hi>ch. vvith Acts</hi> 20.17.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4 — 8. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.16.17. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12.13.14.27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.17.24. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.2. vvhere the Apoſtle calleth the aſſemblies of Chriſtians, <hi>Synagogues:</hi> vvhich (as I noted before) may haue reference to the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues of the Ievves. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4, 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 4, 16 — 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.5.14.15.42. <hi>and</hi> 14.1. <hi>and</hi> 17.1.2. <hi>and</hi> 18.4.7.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As alſo Ieruſalem was the place, whither the Iewes were bound to come thriſe a yere, and where the high Prieſt and the other Prieſts and Levites that miniſtred there, were bound to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and performe the other duties of their callings, for the vvhole church, from time to time, according as the Lord particularly appointed in his word.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yea the higher and greater that the members and functions are, which the Lord hath ſet in his church, the more undoubted it is, that they are ſpecially deſcribed in his word, and the more needfull both for the church and the Officers themſelues, to haue certain knowledge and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thereof. As was for the chief Prieſts, &amp; other officers of the church of Iſraell.</p>
               <p>Neceſſarie therefore it is, that the Dioceſan and Provinciall Churches (if any ſuch vvere planted by the Apoſtles) and the office, entrance, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, of Dioceſan and Provinciall Bishops (vvhich challenge to be chief in the church, and diſtinct from the Paſtors and Bishops of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar churches) should be shewed out of the Scriptures, by ſuch as hold &amp; would uphold them, if they could.</p>
               <p>The Catholike church of Rome (as they call it) and the univerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop thereof, I omit: as being Antichriſtian moſt of all, and juſtly left by the Proteſtants and Reformed churches. Though yet far more (in ſome reſpects) might be pretended for this, from the ſtate of Ieruſalem &amp; the High Prieſts, that vvere for the univerſall church, then for the Dioceſan or Provinciall churches and Bishops.</p>
               <p>If any alledge in this behalf (as ſome uſe to doe) the examples of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee</hi> abiding at Epheſus, and <hi>Titus</hi> left at Crete, by the appointment of the Apoſtle, for the overſight and government of thoſe churches, &amp;c. &amp; the ſubſcriptions alſo of thoſe Epiſtles, vvherein both of them are ſtyled, <hi>the firſt Biſhops of thoſe churches:</hi> let theſe things be obſerved thereabout: 1. That thoſe ſubſcriptions are Apocryphall, and not part of the Scripture it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſome Greek copies, and the Syriack, and old Latin tranſlation alſo, haue not this ſtyle or title at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Timothee and Titus were Euangeliſts, vvho were ſent &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Apoſtles, ſometimes to one place, ſometimes to another, as they had occaſion. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5.9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>and</hi> 3.12. whereas the Paſtors &amp; Bishops vvere appointed to their peculiar flock and ſeat. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17, 28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1 — 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. <hi>and</hi> 2.1.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If eyther of theſe were ſo particularly
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:8260:142"/>
employed afterward, it helps not the matter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The firſt Epiſtle of Timothee, hath not this in the ſubſcription. And in the latter Epiſtle, where the ſubſcription ſtyleth Timothee, <hi>the firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the church of the Epheſians,</hi> there doth Paul in the ſame Epiſtle, both terme him <hi>an Euangeliſt,</hi> and exhorte him to doe <hi>the work of an Euangeliſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 4.5. yea and call him from the church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> (which was in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia) to come unto him to <hi>Rome,</hi> (which was in Italie) 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, 9, 21. if the ſubſcription be right. Likevviſe in the Epiſtle to Titus, vvhere the ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption ſtyleth him, <hi>the firſt Biſhop of the church of the Cretians,</hi> there doth Paul, in the ſame Epiſtle, call him from <hi>Creta</hi> (in Greece) to <hi>Nicopolis</hi> (in Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.) <hi>Tit.</hi> 1, 5. <hi>vvith</hi> 3, 12. And theſe things may be obſerved in thoſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelues, vvhere theſe ſubſcriptions are: beſides that other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures doe alſo shevve, hovv they vvere ſometimes in one part of the world, and ſometimes in another, ſometimes in Aſia, and ſometimes in Europe, doing the duties of their office. As that Timothee vvas in Aſia, in divers countreyes and parts thereof, in <hi>Phrygia, Galatia, Myſia, Ionia, &amp;c.</hi> And in Europe alſo, <hi>in Macedonia, Achaia, Italie, &amp;c.</hi> And in theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes and nations, ſometimes in one city and with one church, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vvith another, for divers occaſions &amp; purpoſes: as namely at <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica,</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Philippi, &amp;c.</hi> For al vvhich ſee theſe Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 16 <hi>ch. and</hi> 17, 14, 15. <hi>and</hi> 18, 5. <hi>and</hi> 19, 22. <hi>and</hi> 20, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16, 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 17. <hi>and</hi> 16, 10, 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1, 1. <hi>and</hi> 2, 19, 22, 23. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3, 1, 2, 6. <hi>with both the Epiſtles to Timothee</hi> And that Titus likevviſe was ſometimes in Europe, at divers places: as at <hi>Corinth</hi> in Achaia; at <hi>Rome</hi> in Italie; in <hi>Creta,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia</hi> in Greece, &amp;c. And ſometimes in Aſia, as at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in Iudea, at <hi>Nicopolis</hi> in Armenia, &amp;c. As is evident by theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, 23, 24. <hi>and</hi> 12, 18. <hi>Gal</hi> 2.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1, 4, 5. <hi>and</hi> 3.12, <hi>vvith the whole Epiſtle to Titus.</hi> By vvhich alſo appeareth, that Timothee and Titus, were Euangeliſts, &amp; ſo imployed by the Apoſtle Paul, ſundry times, and in ſundry places.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beſides, the church of Epheſus, vvas a particular, &amp; not a Dioceſan or Provinciall church: as may appeare both by the places, vvhere it is particularly ſpoken off, <hi>Acts</hi> 20, 17 — 28. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. <hi>and</hi> 3.15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1, 11.12. <hi>and</hi> 2.1. &amp; by the like eſtate of the other Churches of Aſia, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unto by Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4.11.12.13.16.20. <hi>and</hi> 2.8.12.18. <hi>and</hi> 3.17.14. <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vvith Col.</hi> 4.16. And ſo this toucheth not the point in hand. Creta in deed is an Iland, wherein were divers cities: but in every of them were Elders and Bishops ordeyned, as is here plainly expreſſed. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1, 5, 6, 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by this Scripture it ſeemeth, that when the Apoſtle departed from thence, all things vvere not yet finished among them: vvhereupon he left Titus behind him, to ſet in order the things that were wanting, and to ordeyne Elders and Bishops in every city. Wherein vvhat other thing did Titus, then vvhat any other Euangeliſt ſo left there might haue done? Which alſo the Apoſtle himſelf might and vvould haue done, if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned there longer, and yet haue ben an Apoſtle ſtill, though for the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:8260:142"/>
time or by that occaſion he had ben ſo particularly imployed there? And when this was done there by Titus, Paul called him from thence to come unto him to Nicopolis: as vve haue noted here before, out of the ſame Epiſtle. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3, 12.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Moreover, the vvord <hi>Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Overſeer</hi> is ſometimes uſed generally and very largely: ſo as the office of an Apoſtle is ſometimes ſo called, <hi>Acts</hi> 1, 20.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And laſtly, vvhy might not the Euangeliſts, being in an office ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Paſtors or Bishops of particular churches, haue and ſupply their place in any Church, vvhere they came and remayned: &amp; yet this be no ground or warrant of Dioceſan or Provincial Bishops &amp; churches: any more then Iames ſo being at Ieruſalem, who othervviſe vvas an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle? <hi>Act.</hi> 21.18. <hi>Euſeb. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 23. <hi>&amp; l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp; l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>For the further conſideration vvhereof, beſides that vvhich hath ben ſaid before, I will here propound two things (in an other<note n="†" place="margin">Reaſons touching co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Miniſt. of the church of Engl. p. <hi>26.</hi> &amp;c.</note> treatiſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned heretofore) vvhich as they shalbe found to haue waight, may giue more light to theſe and other points ſometimes called in queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is this: Whether the Lords ordinance in his church be not ſuch, as the higher offices conteyne in them and comprehend the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or offices: ſo as they vvhich be in the greater offices, haue (beſides their ovvne peculiar function, vvhereunto they ought to attend) povver and authoritie both themſelues to performe the duties of the inferiour offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when there is needfull occaſion; and to look that they be performed by all ſuch as they are ſpecially layd upon, for the better ſervice of the Lord and his church therein. As may be obſerved, both by the eſtate of Iſraell heretofore, in the Prieſts, and Levites, &amp;c. and by divers things written concerning the Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, Paſtors, and other Elders, in ſundry caſes. For example, that the Apoſtles, who were in the greateſt ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall office ordeyned by Chriſt under the Goſpell, had (beſides the peculiar office of Apoſtleship) the povver alſo and authoritie of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Euangeliſts, Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, &amp; Deacons, both to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them upon juſt occaſion themſelues, &amp; to ſee them performed by others as is aforeſaid. In like ſort, that the Euangeliſts (beſides their own peculiar office and function) had in them the povver and authority of the inferior offices of Paſtors, Teachers, and Elders, &amp;c.

               <p n="6">6. And touching the Deacons office it ſelf, note alſo how it is diſtinct from the office of the miniſters of the vvord: ſo as the Apoſtles thought it not to be meet or reaſon, that they should attend to the duties thereof, together vvith their miniſterie: but that others should be appointed to that function: &amp; that they vvould giue themſelues continually to prayer, and to the miniſterie of the word. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2.4. And thus alſo the offices of the <hi>Miniſters, Deacons,</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> are reckned as diſtinct, by the Apoſtle Paul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7.8.</p>

               <p>Accordingly doe the old and nevv Writers teach, about the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments and other holy things of God in the church, that difference should ſtil be kept, betvveen the Miniſters &amp; the people.

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Apoſtle teacheth, that Chriſt at the firſt celebration thereof, ſaid, <hi>This doe ye, as oft as ye drinke it, in remembrance of me:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon inferreth, <hi>As often as ye eat this bread and drinke this cup, ye doe ſhewe the Lords death till he come.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 25, 26. Which plainly implyeth the <hi>often</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation thereof, in remembrance of Chriſt, and his death.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

A remainder of vvhich practiſe, for celebration of the Lords ſupper every Lords day, as alſo of the dayly vvorship of God (and of ſome other like things good to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) may be ſeen in the Cathedrall churches at this day: though with corruptions othervviſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The nature end &amp; uſe of the Lords ſupper may likevviſe lead here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: inaſmuch as it is the ſacrament of our continuall nourishment and comfort in the church by Ieſus Chriſt: as baptiſme is of our once entring thereinto: And is alſo the memorial of the death of Chriſt, which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred for our ſinnes: and should therefore ſtil be remembred, and often ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated of us with thankeſgiving. According as Chriſt himſelf hath taught, ſaying: <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> and again, <hi>This doe ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 24, 25. By which meanes our faith is the more ſtrengthned, our hope increaſed, our mutuall loue nourished, and vve ſtill ſtirred up, with all thankfulnes to aſcribe unto God the praiſe of our ſalvation in Ieſus Chriſt. In vvhich reſpect alſo it may fitly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> or <hi>Thankeſgiving.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16 — 18. <hi>and</hi> 11.23 — 26. <hi>compared vvith Mat.</hi> 26.26.27.28. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.22 — 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41.42. <hi>and</hi> 20.7. <hi>vvith Numb.</hi> 28.9.10. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 44.15.16.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And note here, hovv the Papiſts and Lutherans doe much urge, (though diverſly) the having of Images, for the better remembrance of Chriſt, and to be in ſtead of books for the unlearned people, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Chriſt hath appointed himſelf to be deſcribed, and his people to be taught and put in remembrance of him, not by Images, but by his Goſpel and Sacraments: <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. <hi>and</hi> 28.18.19.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>and</hi> 11.23 — 26. And therewithall let it be obſerved, whether that Images vvere not then moſt of all brought into the churches and private houſes, under the pretences aforeſaid, vvhen the diligent teaching of the Goſpell, and often celebration of the Lords Supper, did by degrees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and ceaſe more and more in the parishionall churches among the people. So as the Miniſters becomming themſelues dumbe, non reſident, or ſlothfull, the Images (though alſo dumbe) vvere made to ſupply their place, being novv ſet up to be the peoples teachers and remembrancers another way, in ſtead of the liuely preaching of the vvord, &amp; careful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Lords ſupper; for the continuall shevving forth and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:8260:149"/>
of his death from time to time. Which therefore may the more ſtirre up the churches (novv being reformed) not onely to abandon the foreſaid Images, but alſo diligently to uſe both the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, &amp; often communicating at the Lords Table, the better to meet with the corruptions of later times, and to returne to the intier practiſe of the churches that vvere in former ages.</p>

Furthermore, the Lords ſupper (being rightly conſidered) is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable not onely to the Paſſeover, but to the other Feaſts alſo and ſacrifices had at Ieruſalem: And the Prophets ſpeaking of the times of the Goſpel, (under the termes of the shadovves of the Lavv) foretold that <hi>from one Nevv moone to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all fleſh ſhould come to vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before the Lord, at Jeruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> Which by the practiſe aforeſaid care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved, vve may performe and enjoy in Chriſt, who is the truth &amp; body of all thoſe types and shadovves.

               <p>Another queſtion there is, about the time of the day, vvhen the Lords ſupper should be celebrated, vvhether in the morning or euening, &amp;c.

               <p n="1">1. That the having of it then at euen, vvas upon ſpeciall occaſion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it follovved the celebration of the Paſſeover, which was kept at euen.

               <p n="1">1. That ſo they practiſed in the primitiue Churches: as may appeare both by ſome ſpeaches in the Scripture, <hi>Iude, ver.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 20— 34. and by the record of auncient writers, <hi>Clement, Tertullian, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Now whence this practiſe firſt aroſe, I leaue further to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Onely for the point in hand, this I note, that vvhether they did it for the better nourishing &amp; continuing of loue &amp; peace among themſelues; or for the more comforting &amp; refreshing of the poor by the richer ſort, &amp; together with them; or that they had therein reſpect to the action of Chriſt, who celebrated the Lords ſupper after the eating of the Paſſeover (<hi>Luke</hi> 22.7 — 20.) or that they took this cuſtome (as they did many other things) from the Ievves, vvho vvere woont to haue feaſts together with their ſacrifices (ſpecially with their thanks offerings) and at their ſolemne feſtivities; or that they had it from ſome other like originall; it cometh to a like end, as touching the matter ſpoken off. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12, 7. <hi>and</hi> 16, 1 — 15. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1, 4. <hi>with Exod.</hi> 32, 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116, 12, 13, 14, <hi>with</hi> 66, 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>On the other hand may be conſidered, how it is obſerved and noted<note n="†" place="margin">Paraeus in 1 Cor. 11.22.

               <p n="2">2. Now alſo the obſervation of dayes &amp; times that was under the Law a shadow of good things to come, is accomplished in Chriſt. And the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall difference of dayes is taken away together with the reſt of the Ievvish shadowes and ceremonies: all times being ſanctified in Chriſt to the name and vvorship of God, ſo as vve haue not now ſuch need or uſe of yerely rites and obſervations, as was heretofore under the Lavv, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts exhibiting in the flesh. <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 16, 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4, 10, 11. <hi>with Eſa</hi> 66, 23. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3, 16, 17.</p>

               <p n="5">5.

                  <p>
                     <hi>The moſt learned Chaldee Paraphraſt Jonathan ſpeaketh thus, of Aethanim.</hi> It is the moneth of the auncient, and they called it the firſt moneth, of feſtivity. But novv it is the ſeuenth moneth. <hi>Thus David Kimchi doth expound him:</hi> Aethanim or Strength is the moneth wherein they gathered the fruits &amp; encreaſe of the earth, to their houſes. For that cauſe it is called the feaſt of gathering fruites: So Aethanim meaneth ſtrength: and fruites and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the earth be the life of a man. And ſome of our Doctors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Aethanim, the moneth in which the Fathers were borne: the ſtay (Aethanim) of the world; as the ſpeach, Mich. 6, 2. Heare ye mountaines, and ye ſtrong foundations of the earth. Others call it Aethanim, from the ſtrength of the Lavves that are giuen for this moneth, both feaſts, and lawes, <hi>So Ralbag ſaith,</hi> I think it called the moneth Aethanim, for the feaſts: the ſtrong, and teaching juſtice: vvhich are in this moneth. <hi>Thus far Ralbag. The firſt day had the Trumpets; the tenth, Expiation; the fifteenth, the feaſt of Tabernacles, for eight dayes. And Jonathans words cited of me afore, be thus expounded of Cimchi:</hi> Before the time, that Iſraell came from Aegypt, Tiſri or Aethanim vvas the firſt moneth. For in Tiſri, the vvorld vvas made. And by reaſon that the Children of Iſraell came from Egypt in Niſan, it became the head of moneths, and Tiſri became the ſeuenth. For ſo the bleſſed God ſaid unto them: This moneth shalbe unto you the firſt of moneths. To you, by reaſon that to the reſt of the vvorld it is not firſt: For Tiſri is the firſt. <hi>And thus much for the moneth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So Iohn Baptiſt well might begin the firſt day, and aſſemble unto him much people
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:8260:153"/>
fourteen dayes: and our Lord come to him the fifteenth day, when they had learned of the ſtronger then the Baptiſt, who would baptize with the holy Ghoſt and with fyer. So the fower Euangeliſts celebrating the Baptiſme, celebrate the birth, vvhich vvas the ſame day</hi> 29 <hi>full yeres. So as the firſt Adam, and the other to Noah, came into the World that moneth, Chriſt ſhould come: And that time vvas fitteſt for Caeſar to bid men reſort to their cities: And moſt likely that ſhepheards vvould yet be abroad vvith their ſheep: And fitteſt for men to goe into a river naked to be baptized. And by Daniels half ſeuen, Iohn brought in Baptiſme; for Heathen; as David and Salomon onely baptiſed Proſelytes.</hi> Maimony in Aſure Bia, tract. 12, &amp; 13. <hi>And if his vvarrant had not ben ſure and plaine, from Daniell, none might haue come to him for Baptiſme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So our Lord beginning a nevv yere of his age then, ſhevved the ſame time of the moneth to haue giuen us his comming into the World. And the Rabbines in Midras Rabba conclude that Meſſias ſhalbe borne in Aethanim or Tifri; full of feaſts, to teach of him. And God appointed no feaſts for the Winter: becauſe of the unſeaſonablenes of the Weather. Chryſoſtome miſtaking Iohns Fathers ſtorie, thinking that he miniſtred not in Iune but in September, began to diſgrace the ſtate of the Goſpell. Hence Turk and Jevv ſcoff, that vve place the birth, vvhere the conception ſhould be; and can yeeld no reaſon of our Gospels narrations, vvhich vve make moſt unlikely to be true. And An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Montanus helps Chryſoſtome, that Zacharie ſhould be high Sacrificer: Whereas all Ievves knovv, that the Candleſtick, Table, and Altar of incenſe vvere vvithout, and daily gone to by the ordinarie ſacrificers. Elias, fovver times made the beginning of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels half ſeuen, might haue taught the Ievves a ſure note, vvhat Elias, Malachie ſpake off. Novv the end of all the Euangeliſts is in the firſt moneth, tovvards leaving the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt of this World at the Paſcha. And at Pentecoſt after, the Lavv vvas giuen to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, vvhen the fiery lavv of the spirit vvas by Jeſus giuen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So the conception of John, vvhere men placed his birth, falleth to Midſommer; and birth to the ſpring Aequinoctiall: and likewiſe the conception of Mary fell moſt fitly to Mid-winter; and our Lords comming into the world, to the</hi>

Broughton; whoſe obſervations about this matter, I thought here to inſert, becauſe they are of great waight, and giue great light to the point in hand.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Hither alſo may be referred, that Chriſt, after he was baptized, was fower Paſſeovers at Ieruſalem: and that<note n="”" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 3, 21, 23.</note> being baptized at that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the yere when he was borne: the things vvhich he did betvveene his baptiſme and the firſt Paſſeover, vvere ſo many and of ſuch ſort, as might well take up all the time betvveene September and the Paſſeover in March follovving: As namely, his being in the wildernes where he was tempted, fourty dayes. <hi>Mark</hi> 1, 9 — 13. His abiding ſome while about the place vvhere Iohn baptiſed, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1, 28, 29, 35, 43. His departing into Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee: and going both to Cana of Galilee, where he was at a mariage, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2, 1 — 11. and to Nazareth, vvhere (as his cuſtome vvas) he vvent into the Synagogue, and preached on the Sabbath day. <hi>Luke</hi> 4, 16. and from thence to Capernaum, vvhere he dvvelt, and taught likewiſe on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4, 12, 13. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1, 14, 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 4, 31. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2, 12. His journey
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:8260:153"/>
alſo from thence to Ieruſalem, to the Paſſeover (the firſt Paſſeover, after he vvas baptized) vvhich is ſpoken off, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2, 13. beſides that he did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, which are not all particularly recorded. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21, 25. Thus then might vvel ſo much time be ſpent, as was between September &amp; March, vvherein the firſt Paſſeover following his Baptiſme vvas celebrated.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Eſpecially, here is to be obſerved, the half ſeuen, of three yeres and an half (ſpoken off by Daniell) wherein Chriſt preached, after he was baptized. Whereunto fitly anſvvereth the ſpace of time between Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and March, conteyning half a yere or ſix moneths: whereas if the reckoning be made from the end of December (where the nativity of Chriſt is now commonly placed) unto the Paſſeover in March following, there vvilbe but onely three moneths, and not ſix moneths or the half yere, before ſpoken off. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.27. Whereunto alſo (as touching the time) that phraſe of ſpeach may haue reference, vvhich is uſed concerning the vvoman in the Revelation, of <hi>a time, and times, and half a time. Rev.</hi> 12.14.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Finally, as the Lords ſupper now among Chriſtians, anſwereth to all the Sacrifices which they had in Iſraell heretofore: ſo alſo the Lords day now is to us in ſtead of all their Feaſts and holy dayes of Sabbaths, Nevv moones, Paſſeover, Pentecoſt, and Tabernacles. So as novv vve haue no cauſe or need of ſuch yerely dayes and Feaſts, as then they had; Chriſt being come, who is the body of all thoſe shadowes, vvhereof the Feaſts vvere a part. <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 16, 17. <hi>compared vvith Eſa.</hi> 66, 23. <hi>Act.</hi> 20, 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1, 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of vvhich, ſee more here before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2, <hi>and</hi> 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other hand, there is alledged the ordinance concerning <hi>the Feaſt of</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Or, <hi>Lots.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Purim,</hi> enacted by Mardochee and Eſter, &amp; accepted by the Iewes for them and their generations after them, in memorie of their deliverance from the tretcherie of Haman, &amp;c. <hi>Eſter</hi> 9, 20— 32. Touching vvhich, theſe things may be obſerved: 1. that the book of Eſter (wherein this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded) is Canonicall Scripture: and vvhether it were written by Ezra, or by Mardochee himſelf, or by ſome Prophet that lived in thoſe times; as the book it ſelf, ſo alſo the Feaſt there ſpoken off, hath the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit of God, by vvhich that hiſtorie was written. And who can ſay othervviſe, but that the Feaſt aforeſaid vvas in deed ordeyned &amp; agreed upon by ſpeciall inſtinct and direction of the ſpirit of God?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Feaſt might alſo be a civill ordinance and ſolemnity, kept in memoriall of the deliverance aforeſaid. And ſo much might both the maner of enacting it, and the name and uſe of it likewiſe import; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtablished accounted &amp; obſerved, as <hi>a time of feaſting and joy, and a good day, and of ſending portions one to another, and gifts to the poore. Eſther</hi> 9, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 — 29 — 32.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And hovv ever it were obſerved, whether as an ordinance civill, or eccleſiaſticall, or both: yet this is evident, that this vvas done in the time before Chriſt, when as now they had the obſervances of the lavv, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their Feaſts vvere a part by the ordinance of God: from the bondage vvhereof vve are now freed by Chriſt, and are taught by the Apoſtle to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:8260:154"/>
ſtand faſt in the liberty vvherevvith Chriſt hath made us free, and not to be intangled againe vvith the yoke of bondage. Concerning which, the Apoſtle reproving the Chriſtians ſaith, <hi>Ye obſerue dayes, and moneths, &amp; times, and yeares: I am afrayd of you, leaſt I haue beſtowed upon you labour in vayne. Gal.</hi> 4, 10, 11. <hi>and</hi> 5, 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which laſt reaſon may be obſerved in like ſort, about <hi>the Feaſt of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi> ſpoken off, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10, 22, 23. (at vvhich time Iohn ſaith, Chriſt walked in the Temple, in Salomons porch, and reaſoned vvith the Iewes) which vvas a Feaſt ordeyned by Iudas Machabeus and the Congregation of Iſrael, in remembrance of the dedication of the Altar, ſpoken off, 1 <hi>Mach.</hi> 4, 59. Whereunto likevviſe may be applied the former reaſon, touching the Feaſts and shadovves then uſed, vvhich typed out our ſpiritual joy in Chriſt, vvho is the trueth and body of all thoſe shadowes and obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>And vvhereas ſome, for defence of Holy dayes invented by men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>the voluntarie ſacrifices had in Iſraell:</hi> let theſe things further be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereabout: 1. That thoſe ſacrifices in Iſraell vvere to be ſuch one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as God had preſcribed, &amp; ſo to be obſerved, as the Lord had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 2. That no Prince or perſons might forbid or take them away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne. Which I ſuppoſe vvill not be ſaid touching the aforeſaid ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Holy dayes. 3. That they vvere not urged upon Churches or perſons againſt their will, as the Holy dayes preſcribed by men now be. 4. That this or that man might bring them upon ſpeciall occaſion, vvhen the vvhole Church was not bound thereunto: vvhereas the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation aforeſaid is laid as a duty upon vvhole Churches, and not left vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie to this or that man, to doe or leaue undone, as they ſee cauſe. 5. That many vvho obſerue and plead for them, doe ſometimes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to be humane ordinances, vvishing they were taken avvay, and keep them againſt their will. And hovv then can they be accounted as the voluntarie ſacrifices vvhich the Lord preſcribed, and Iſraell obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of old? 6. Finally, if this plea vvere good and ſufficient in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, vvhat inventions of men are there in religion, that ſome would not thus plead for, that they are as the voluntarie ſacrifices had in Iſraell: &amp; ſo open a vvide doore to all vvill worship, and in deed take avvay the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commandement, or ſecurely tranſgreſſe it under ſuch colours and pretences?</p>

               </p>
               <p>It doth in deed lye alſo upon Kings and all other Magiſtrates (within their dominions, cities, &amp; juriſdictions) to haue ſpecial care of the eſtate of the miniſters and churches under them, as of all other duties concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning religion apperteyning unto them: after the example of Hezekiah king of Iudah, and Nehemiah the Prince, and other the like. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31, 2 — 21. <hi>vvith</hi> 29, <hi>and</hi> 30 <hi>chap.

Yet notvvithſtanding, this should not hinder the foreſaid duty of the churches and people themſelues: but should rather further it: and that not onely in affording help where there is want; but alſo in requiring of ſuch as are able, that this duety be carefully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by themſelues, where by the flock and church it ſelf it can be done: according to the examples aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>This poynt concerning the Miniſters maintenance is the more to be obſerved, that not onely care may be had for ſuch as are faithfull and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, to be encouraged in the Lavv of the Lord, but that (vvhat in us is) the way may be ſtopped, and the meanes taken away of mainteyning Popish Prieſts, and other erroneous Miniſters: vvho are vvoont often (vvhere Antichriſtian or other corruptions prevaile) to ſucceed and come after ſuch as are ſound in the faith, and to be taken into their places: and ſo to haue the ſame maintenance, as the other had before. Beſides that where the Miniſters haue their maintenance onely of the Magiſtrates, it may be a meanes to drawe ſuch as are weak or not ſyncere, to carry themſelues in their Miniſterie and religion, ſo as may pleaſe the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, by vvhom they are mainteyned: eyther being unſound in the

faith, or not doing the vvork of the Miniſterie vvith that courage and faithfulnes as becommeth the Miniſters of Chriſt, and the houſehold-ſtewards of the myſteries of God.</p>

And vvhether the ſolemnization of mariage should not therefore be done, by the Fathers or Tutors of the parties maried; or by the civill Magiſtrate; rather then by the Miniſters, as a part of their eccleſiaſticall adminiſtration. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2, 22.23.24. <hi>and</hi> 29.21.22. <hi>Ruth</hi> 4, 1 — 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13, 4. <hi>with</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe we find not in the Scriptures, that it is a part of the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall adminiſtration, layd upon the Miniſters by the vvord of God, as a peculiar dutie of their Miniſterie. Or if it were, then should the parents and Magiſtrates offend, taking upon them to doe a ſpeciall vvork of the Miniſterie, vvhenſoever they should joyne any together in the band of mariage. The contrarie whereof may appeare, by the foreſaid places of Scripture, and other the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it appeareth, that of old it might be done by the Fathers, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or civill Magiſtrates: <hi>Gen.</hi> 29, 21, 22. <hi>and,</hi> 41, 45. <hi>Ruth</hi> 4, 1 — 13. <hi>with Heb.</hi> 13, 4. And there is no Law giuen ſince to the contrarie.</p>

And the Papiſts, who think that Matrimonie is a Sacrament, are the more confirmed in their errour: vvhiles they ſee that the ſolemnization thereof is by the Proteſtants annexed to the Miniſterie of the vvord, and required to be done of the Miniſters, in the churches meetings, by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Leitourgie, as if it were a part or peculiar duety of their eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall miniſtration.</p>

Which all therefore should further (what in us is) and endeavour to attaine unto: being aſſured that ſuch as come neareſt to the ſynceritie of the Primitiue Churches (both in the faith, and order thereof) they are in the beſt eſtate: and that the nearer and nearer vve come thereunto, it is ſtill the greater bleſſing of God upon us, and the more acceptable to God, and comfortable to our ſelues: hovv ever it be with us othervviſe for our eſtate and troubles in the vvorld: as was alſo the lot of the Primitiue churches of old.
